00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello you beautiful people and welcome to this video where we're going to be talking about how you can

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,330
download the source code for packages.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,150
So at the minute all we've been able to do is download and install precompiled binary packages but we're

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,570
interested in how we might be able to go about getting source code so we can exercise the freedoms that

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,900
free software gives us.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,370
And it's actually a very easy process in order to do so or what to do is as an administrator.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:29,740
So with the sudo command open up in natto the slash at c slash apt slash sourses doc list file.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,950
Ok now in here when you enter your password you're going to be opening up a configuration file the package

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,750
manager uses to determine which repositories and which package files it downloads.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,370
In other words which source is it downloads.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,240
OK so what we're going to do in here is you'll notice that there are lines that start with Debb source

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,770
or Debb dash S or C and those lines have a hash in front of them.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,630
What I want to do is I want to just delete all those hashes on those appropriate lines.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,060
And what this will do is it will activate the ability for your package manager to be able to download

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,490
source code which is deactivated by default just to save efficiency basically.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,930
So we're going to Haven't done that.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm going to press control in 0 to save the file or press X control of X to exit.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,820
So then what we've done is we've said to the package manager hey why don't you go ahead and download

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,540
the package lists that contain source code.

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,260
Ok but to be able to get those things in the cache we've got to update our cash.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,390
OK so all I was do sudo apt get updates and it's going to go ahead and start downloading all the source

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,740
packages here.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,010
So you can see that this is is installing all the source packages into cache.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,630
This is a very useful thing because now we can we're almost ready to be able to download source code.

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,210
OK so before we can download source code we need to install one more package which is so to get installed

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,540
is going to be the package dash dev package the DP K.G. dash dev.

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,860
You install that you type yes when it asks you and there we are we've managed to now it's going to go

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,760
ahead and download and unpack that package and now we can go ahead and install source code.

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,830
It's literally that simple.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,500
OK so we've been messing around with the excise package I made over to the desktop and we've been messing

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,660
around with the excise package.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,590
How can we get the source code for the for the excise package or the exercise program.

33
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,160
Well it's contained in the x 11 apps package.

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,820
So if we do sudo apt get and we used to do install right we do install X 11 apps right.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,140
That's how you'd get the pre-compiled binary version.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,600
But if you want to get the source code it sort of instead of install just put source and you'll see

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,280
that it goes ahead and downloads these packages to contain source code.

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,200
Now we can actually go ahead and enter these using CD.

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,520
So if we CD into the package and take a look around we can see there's is a folder here for X eyes and

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:00,470
if we take a look in X eyes a CD X eyes will be seen here that we've got the source code for the exercise

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,610
program so you can see we've got our config file that we can can use to configure our new C-compiler.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,840
But what we're interested in right now is this excise Dotsie which is actually the source code for the

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
exercise program and we can take a look in here and read the source code for the exercise program.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,960
It's literally that simple.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,400
OK.

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,380
All we had to do was go ahead and change our slash ETSI slash ops slash sources.

47
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,380
Dart last fall and in here just uncomment all the lines that had that had a hash in front of them for

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,450
Debb source.

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,060
And those are the repositories that allow you to actually download source code to view and comment all

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,110
of those and then update your cache using sudo apt get updates then what you've downloaded all the new

51
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:50,930
less We've got to do is install the is install the DP K.G. dev package and then you get to go in there

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,140
from now on if you ever want to download any source code and all you've got to do is sudo apt get source

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,420
and then a package name.

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,100
OK.

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,680
And that is all you need to know in order to be able to download and play around with source code.

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,730
But one thing that you should bear in mind is that if you go into the source code packages and you actually

57
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,930
compile them you'll lose the ability to install them that way you'll lose the ability to keep them updated

58
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,070
with your package manager.

59
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,580
So therefore if you have the choice to install a package through the package manager or install it from

60
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,300
source make sure that you install it through the package manager and through the repositories rather

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,530
than compiling it yourself.

62
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,440
But this is a really cool way to be able to go ahead and take a look at how code works and maybe incorporate

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,670
it in your projects.
