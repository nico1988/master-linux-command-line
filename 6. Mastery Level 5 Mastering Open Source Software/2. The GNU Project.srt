00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,590
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,110
Now one key thing that probably brought you to work with Linux is the idea of open source software.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,220
But what does that term really mean.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,470
Well in this video we're going to talk about the new project and what it actually means for software

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,350
to be open source and the history of the whole open source movement.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,470
So let's go ahead and get into it.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:19,860
OK.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,330
So the first thing that we probably need to understand is what Linux actually is when we hear the word

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,430
Linux we probably think of a whole operating system that we use as being the Linux operating system.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,710
Now surprisingly this is actually not the case and Linux is actually just one of the pieces of the whole

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,840
operating system the kernel.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,290
So let me explain.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,060
On Sept. 27 the September in 1983 a person called Richard Stallman announced that he was going to begin

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,900
developing a operating system that was similar to the Unix operating system but made of entirely free

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,890
software.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,710
Now the operating system was called the new operating system spelled g and U which stands for Ganu is

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,870
not Unix which they like to call a recursive acronym.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,610
OK.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,520
Now in nine in January 1984 Richard Stallman quit his job in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,820
Massachusetts Institute of Technology so MIT to work on the Ganu project full time in the aims of creating

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,660
an operating system made of completely free software.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,360
Now the term free software actually refers to several freedoms that the software gives the user rather

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,090
than being free as in money.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,080
So when you hear the term free software think free speech and not free lunch.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,060
Now these freedoms are the first.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,990
First one is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,680
The first freedom the second freedom is the freedom to study how the program works and change it so

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,630
that it does the computing as you wish.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,860
Which is what freedom one is.

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,500
OK freedom one is that the program will do what you wish.

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,510
Freedom to me is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does as you

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,230
wish.

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,340
Now access to the source code for a program is a precondition for this.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,620
You can't study how a program works and you can look at its code.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
So having access to the source code is a precondition for freedom number.

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,600
The third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies of the software so that you can as they say

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,140
help your neighbor and freedom not before is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified version

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,720
of your software.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,230
If you modify it you can redistribute that Wishings to freedom number 3 of helping other people.

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,660
But by and.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,250
Apparently by doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,190
And again access to the source code is a precondition for this.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,760
OK so if you want to modify software and redistribute it you need to have access to the source code

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,620
in order to be able to change it.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,960
Now there's a license that legally provides a user of software with these freedoms and is known as the

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,710
canoe public license or the GPL.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,250
Now are several versions of the Gonu public license or the GPL but at the time of recording the GPL

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,790
version 3 is the most modern version.

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,590
But in 1991 the new system was almost finished but there was still one part missing from the new operating

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,510
system and it was an important part.

51
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,280
This final piece is a major part of every operating system and it's called the kernel.

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,870
The kernel is responsible for allocating the resources on the computer's hardware that is required by

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,120
the software that is running so it's the interface layer between the computers hardware and the applications

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,910
that it's running.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,760
OK now at this time in 1991 a man called like Linus Torvalds was completing his MFC thesis at the University

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,990
of Helsinki in Finland and as part of this work Lenas invented a Unix like kernel called Linux and it

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,780
was called Linux after his own name.

58
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,930
But everything in the Unix world kind of ends in an X..

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,670
So Linux ending in the next.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Is Linux OK.

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,940
And after being VEIDT after being invited by a fellow student to go see a talk by Richard Stallman who

62
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,360
is also a prominent activist at the time Lenas released the Linux kernel under the version 2 of the

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,140
new Public License or GPL thereby making the Linux kernel free software so Fang's to the Linux kernel

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,140
the new operating system was complete and and was fully runnable operating system made of entirely free

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,240
software.

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,320
With those four freedoms we talked about before and it began to gain popularity and it in fact the Linux

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,980
kernel that is used today on on Android devices and even Chrome OS so if you ever hear people say oh

68
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,550
Android runs Linux or Chrome OS runs Linux what they mean is they use the Linux kernel to interface

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,750
between the software layer and the hardware layer of your computer.

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,450
But because the Linux kernel was the final piece it kind of got a whole lot of attention and the rest

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,160
of the work that went into the new operating system was kind of forgotten.

72
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,150
But because what we run when we run a distribution like a buntu or any other Linux distribution is actually

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
the new operating system and the Linux kernel.

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,110
It was recommended that in order to give the group project its credit instead of just calling the whole

75
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,050
thing Linux we should call it new.

76
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,650
Plus Linux.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,320
In fact there is a command called the you name command that will actually tell you loads of information

78
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,800
about your computer such as what hardware it has and what operating system that it's running.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,430
So if you run the unit in command with the o option it'll tell you your operating systems.

80
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,560
If we run that we see that we can we get Ganu slash Linux as the operating system.

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,590
Sounds pretty cool right.

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,540
OK so with that history understood we now know pretty much all of the commands of you so far in the

83
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,480
course such as the ls command of the find command and so on are all part of the new project and to give

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,930
the users the freedoms that free software provides.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,190
The source code needs to be available to read because access to the source code is a precondition for

86
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,300
those freedoms right.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,160
So in other words the software must be open source.

88
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,900
Ok so the source code must be open be accessible.

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,370
It's open source.

90
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,640
So how come we have a look at the code that our computer runs.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,410
Well it's actually all freely accessible on the canoe project's official Web site Ganu dot org.

92
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:06,410
So if I just open up a Firefox browser here and when that boots up we head over to the new dot org.

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,090
We'll be able to see what I'm talking about so here we are.

94
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,040
Has Firefox.

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,260
Let's go to Ganu dot org and press enter.

96
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,280
There we go.

97
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,250
So you can read all about the philosophy behind the Free Software ideology in more detail and you can

98
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,840
see here it's telling you to try new Linux here.

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,350
But if you head over to the software section if we click on software here and scroll down to a part

100
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,660
that says all good new packages.

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,440
Here it says org new packages.

102
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,240
You can you can see here that there's every This basically links to every bit of code that is run on

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,510
a new system including a free software version of the Linux kernel itself which we can find under the

104
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,660
Linux lb. package say we are Linux lb..

105
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,520
OK that's the that's the package that's the full downloadable folder that contains all of the source

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,850
code for V for the Linux kernel itself.

107
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,980
That's pretty awesome.

108
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:07,300
Now for all the commands that you've run so far this is the ls command grep find whatever it might be.

109
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,390
OK.

110
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,310
You can find those under the core utils package that we'll call you tell.

111
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,780
OK.

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,200
So that's where you can find the stuff in there in that call you tell us package.

113
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,880
And in the next video we're going to download the call utos package modify it and install a new version

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,250
of the ls command to our computer which is going to be super super exciting.

115
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,830
But first let's just take a quick recap of what we've learned in this video.

116
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,150
OK.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,410
So in this video you learned about Richard Stallman beginning the development of the new operating system

118
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,400
in 1983 and the idea was to create a Unix like operating system that was made of entirely free software.

119
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,800
And you learn that when we say the words free software we mean software that provides users with certain

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,520
freedoms so think of free speech rather than free lunch.

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,750
OK.

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,310
Now the Fourth there are four freedoms that the free the free software gives the users so gives the

123
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,600
users the ability to run programs as they wish for any purpose.

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,740
It gives the users the ability to study how a program works and change it so it does the computing as

125
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,230
they wish and access to source code is a precondition for that and it gives the users the ability to

126
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,910
freely freely distribute any copies they get so that they can help other people.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,270
And it also gives the users the ability to distribute modified versions of the software that they create

128
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,490
other people.

129
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,770
So this allows the whole community to benefit from any changes that a user makes.

130
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,330
And again access to source code is a precondition for that as well.

131
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,160
Now these freedoms are legally provided to users using the new Public License or the GPL.

132
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:47,320
And as I as the time of recording the the third version of the GPL GPL version 3 is the most modern

133
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,650
version of the license and open access to the source code is a precondition for giving these freedoms.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,130
So when have software has openly accessible source code it is known as open source software so you can

135
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:07,180
say that free software is open source but not all soft or not all open source software is free software

136
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,010
because while people might let you see the source code that doesn't mean they necessarily give you the

137
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,110
freedoms required to modify and distribute it.

138
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,470
They might just let you see the source code OK but the free software does does require open source software

139
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,380
so it works one way but not the other.

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,150
And you've also learned that in 1991 the new project was almost finished but it had a important missing

141
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,650
piece which was the kernel and the kernel is the part of the operating system.

142
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,860
The interfaces between the hardware and allocates resources from the hardware depending upon what software

143
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,540
requires it.

144
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,800
And in 1991 Linus Torvalds created his own version of a kernel and called it the Linux kernel and released

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,600
it in 1991 under the new Public License version too thereby making it free software.

146
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,810
So the Linux kernel was the final piece for the new operating system and now the two tend to work together.

147
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,480
So when you download a buntu or when you download any other type of Linux distribution what you're actually

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,050
downloading is a version of the new Plus Linux operating system.

149
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,180
So henceforth we won't just call it Linux we'll call it the new Linux operating system.

150
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,010
OK so in the next video now that we understand this little bit of a history lesson we understand about

151
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,560
the freedoms and what open source software is all about.

152
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,940
We're going to play with some source code.

153
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,660
OK we're going to download and take a look at some of the source code for some core commands.

154
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,020
Modify their code and install that modified code on our computer and see how they behave differently.

155
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,410
So it's going to be amazing and it's going to really allow you to see what open source free software

156
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,260
is all about.

157
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,580
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
