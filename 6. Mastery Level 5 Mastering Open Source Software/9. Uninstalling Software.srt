00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,480
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,860
Now as you know there are two sides to every coin.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,650
And now that you've learned how to install packages to your system in this video we're going to be covering

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,940
how you can uninstall packages from your system and make sure that your system is squeaky clean.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,540
So let's just go ahead and get right into it.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,190
OK.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,560
So in the last few videos we've been messing around with the x 11 apps package and we're going to continue

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,540
using that as kind of our guinea pig for this video.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,610
So to uninstall a package in a boon to the most basic way to do it is to type sudo apt get remove and

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,630
then the package name.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,830
OK so because we are talking about the x 11 apps package we just type sudo apt get remove and then x

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,780
11 apps.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,810
And that would remove it but that's not the preferred way to do it.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,090
OK.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,500
And the reason is when you install packages there are sometimes configuration files that come along

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,630
with the packages and if you just remove the package using sudo apt get remove then the configuration

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,670
files are left behind on your system taking up space and not being helpful.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,790
Now this can be useful if you want to install the package again in the future and want all your settings

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,990
to be the same but it's still not really the preferred way to do it.

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,210
Instead to remove a package and all of its configuration files what we do is instead of typing silap

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,370
get removed we type sudo apt get Perge and then the package name.

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,240
Like I a pseudo get purred.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,850
Excellent apps now the purge will remove the package and its configuration files.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,460
So always use Perge whatever you want to install a package.

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,440
So if I go ahead and do that it's going to go and say hey I want to remove this is OK.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,640
I press yes.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,290
I will go through and remove x 11 apps and any of its configuration files so you can see here it says

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,430
purging configuration files for x 11 apps.

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,110
OK so it's gone ahead and done that.

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,670
Now that will have the 11 apps package 100 percent removed from the system.

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,520
But sometimes when you install packages you need to install like 10 other different packages as dependencies.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,010
OK so you need in order to get the package that you want to install to work you need like 10 other packages

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,380
or maybe even a hundred of the packages in order to get that one package to work.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,310
And we call those extra packages dependancies.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,810
So if those dependencies are no longer required but you don't know what they're called How can you remove

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,240
them.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,670
Well you're in luck in order to remove packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,780
required for any other package on the system.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,720
You can just do sudo factory the screen sudo apt get auto remove and that's it.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,690
So sudo get or to remove now or to remove will automatically remove any dangling dependencies that are

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,060
no longer required which helps you save space on your systems if I do that it's going to tell me there's

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,950
actually not any that need to be removed but you can save a lot of space in this.

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,740
So bear in mind this is all happening across hundreds or even thousands of different packages on your

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,110
system and having the package manager keep everything in order automatically is a really great asset.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm sure you'd agree it beats doing it yourself anyway.

46
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,020
Now whenever you download and install a package or a copy of the package is saved locally on your computer.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,890
Now if this package is then unpacked and stored on your systems that's how it works when you install

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,750
a package download itself as a compressed archive then unpacks itself and installs itself on your system.

49
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,260
OK.

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,020
Because that two step process not only has a package installed on your system but a compressed version

51
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,480
of it is also saved at least compressed files usually take up space and aren't really necessary if you

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,710
already have the package installed and because they're just you know an archive like the wrapper that

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,490
comes with the stuff.

54
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,160
OK.

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,940
So you can actually save yourself massive amounts of space between gigabytes of space just by deleting

56
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,830
these archives.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,320
OK.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,100
Now these archives are stored.

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,850
If we go that slash var slash cache slash apt slash archive.

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,580
So if we go there and take a look we can say there's quite a few little deadfalls here some compressed

61
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,590
archives saved and then you can see the one for x 11 apps even though we've actually removed it from

62
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,230
the system.

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,760
And you can see how large these are by doing ls with the El-Hage command.

64
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,750
And you can see that there's a total of about 10 megabytes in there and that's not much.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,690
But you know this can easily grow to gigabytes after you keep installing packages on your system.

66
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,090
It can get quite mad because every package you install comes with its own dependencies.

67
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,890
And even those dependencies are saved as copies so you can really save a lot of space by removing the

68
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,810
stuff from here.

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,720
Now you don't have to even be in the folder to remove them so if I just head back to our home directory

70
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:26,220
and there you can see where our home directory if we run sudo apt get clean that will delete all of

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,800
the packages from that directory.

72
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,800
If we had back up into the slash var slash cache slash and slash archives into an address we can see

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,230
that either.

74
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,900
Or been deleted even though we weren't in that folder.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,590
So if you want to get rid of all that stuff do sudo apt get clean.

76
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,900
But sometimes you don't want to delete all of those for whatever reason and you only want to get rid

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,910
of the stuff you want to get rid of those packages those those those archives but the ones for packages

78
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,070
that can no longer be accessed from the from the actual Aponte repulsive areas that this is usually

79
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,480
for systems that are very old and want to keep their cash going for years and years and years and then

80
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,250
from now and then just trim the leaves and get rid of the deb packages that can no longer be downloaded

81
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,540
for whatever reason and to do that instead of using sudo apt get clean.

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,560
You do use auto clean now as just to highlight clean gets rid of everything of those in the archive

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,200
cache that is different from the from the list cache.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,220
By the way that's just a this is just a storage space for for saved archives and packages and stuff

85
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,400
so this is a completely different cache.

86
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,250
But clean will remove everything in there and auto clean will check what's in there and only delete

87
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,730
the ones that you can no longer download from the repositories to make sure you don't have stuff in

88
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,820
there that you'll never use again.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,600
So they have a no nonsense guide to uninstalling packages.

90
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,680
So let's review.

91
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,040
OK we discuss at the most basic way to review packages is to use sudo apt get remove and then the package

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,490
name.

93
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,380
But this is not recommended because it leaves behind configuration files.

94
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,440
Instead use sudo apt get Perge and then the package name.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,600
OK now when you install the package it's likely the other dependency packages were also installed in

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,760
order to make that package work in order to get rid of those dependencies and automatically remove them

97
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,400
from the system.

98
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,150
As long as they're are no longer required you would use sudo apt get auto remove or to remove any unwanted

99
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,540
and needed dependencies.

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,040
OK.

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,110
And just because they were used for one package and you loof that package doesn't mean they're no longer

102
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,050
needed for another.

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,870
But don't worry about that.

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,560
The package is going to take care of all that for you OK.

105
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,780
And you also learned that when a software package is installed it is first downloaded and saved on your

106
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,700
system in a compressed archive.

107
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,950
This archive is safe on your system even if the package is installed.

108
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,580
And that means it's taking up space.

109
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,100
It's not like the wrapper or the packaging behind the actual thing that you want.

110
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,400
OK so to clean up all the packaging and clean up all that stuff what ever do is sudo apt get clean and

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,140
that's going to delete all the compressed package archives and save you a heck of a lot of space.

112
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,610
You'll be surprised sometimes even gigabytes at times.

113
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,530
But perhaps you don't want to clean up all of those packages for some reason and instead said you just

114
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,840
want to clean up the ones that can no longer be downloaded from the buntu repositories.

115
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,550
So for that you use sudo to get auto clean.

116
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,180
OK so there you have it.

117
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,540
Beautiful people you know.

118
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,440
Everything that you will ever need to know about package management InnoCentive and they've done so

119
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,330
unbelievably well that in the next video I would like to congratulate you and have a recap of what we've

120
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,840
learned.

121
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,260
So for some well-deserved praise and a recap I'll see you in the next video.
