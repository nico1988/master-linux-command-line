00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,530
Hellova you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,610
So in the last video I left you with kind of a cliffhanger with some burning questions that we have

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,090
about how apt package manager works.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,100
How does the cache get there in the first place.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,430
How can we make sure that the cash is kept up to date.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,100
Well these are the questions that we'll be answering in this video by the end of this video you'll know

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,290
how to update your cash.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,360
And you also know how to use that cash to upgrade all of the software on your system to the most uptodate

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,750
level with one simple command.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,660
And this is going to be so awesome and I'm sure that you are you'll begin to see why package managers

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,680
are far superior to the simple wizards that you may be used to using.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,030
Now I can't wait to show you this stuff.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,400
So let's just go ahead and get right into it.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,260
OK.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,870
So how do the lists in the cache actually get there in the first place.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,700
Well these lists are actually downloaded from servers somewhere on the Internet and these servers are

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,850
maintained by credible sources and contain up to date lists of all existing packages.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,240
And as we mentioned in the last video in order for our cash to be functional the files in the cache

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,630
must be the same as the files on the server.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,710
This is especially important for the software repositories.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,530
So I think with me about the Linux community for another there are millions of people around the world

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,160
all contributing to this massive body of software and creating things all the time.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,080
This massive body of people contributing simultaneously to the software repositories and products that

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,850
software changes a lot and it changes often.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,060
Bugs get fix security holes get patched.

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,010
New features get added.

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,720
Documentation is codified and so on and so forth.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,770
Now sometimes programs get developed so much that they require new dependencies in order to work.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,130
And in spite all of these changes keep in all the software on your system today and managing everything

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,060
yourself manually would just be a complete nightmare.

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,260
It just wouldn't work.

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,460
There's too much room for a person to make a mistake and too much stuff to keep track of.

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,740
But fortunately you don't have to.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,390
The apt package manager has a way of using the cache to make sure that all the software on your system

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,800
is completely up to date.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,700
And here's how it works.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,910
So the first thing you need to do is to update your cash and to do that you'd run sudo apt get update.

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,680
OK and that's the command you'd run.

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,920
Now notice how we need to use the sudo command at the beginning here.

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,480
Now that's because we're going to make changes to important files on our file system and we need administrator

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,060
privileges in order to do so.

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,460
And instead of apt cache we're using apt get because we're going to get data from the repositories so

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,090
we'll be getting the updated lists and update we'll update the lists and our cash to make sure that

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,640
the package versions in there are the same as the package versions in the repositories.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,470
But of course in order for this to work we need to be connected to the Internet.

46
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,430
So I relabeled our internet connection before recording this video.

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,050
So if you are following along make sure you re-enable yours too.

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,350
And if we run now so sudo apt get update it will ask us to enter our password because we are using the

49
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,110
sudo commands or we enter that and we press enter and you can see that it's getting loads of different

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,890
lists from the buntu repositories and it's downloaded them and installing them.

51
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,500
Now it's going to be updating our cash which might take various amount of time depending on how long

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,880
it's been since you've updated.

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,770
But ours is gone and completed now.

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,260
So now that we've updated the cache will have the most up to date package numbers and dependencies for

55
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,670
all the packages in cash so that we have an up to date cache.

56
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,410
What if some of the software on our computer is out of date.

57
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,020
How can we upgrade our software to the newest versions that are in the new versions of the package lists.

58
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,440
Well that's actually really easy and quite magical to be honest.

59
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,760
So to upgrade every single piece of software on your system that you install from the repository is

60
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,840
all you need to do is type.

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,800
I play the screen sudo apt get upgrade.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,370
OK now this will run through so Representer.

63
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,670
This will run through all the package lists and see all the software that we've got on our system and

64
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,530
it will tell us what's out of date and what needs to be updated and it also tell you how much needs

65
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,280
to be installed and so on and it asks for approbation to continue.

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,050
If I press yes.

67
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,060
So this is going to run on through the updated cache and see what packages on your system are behind

68
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,630
it and figure out what new dependencies need to be installed and which ones are no longer required.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,930
They'll tell you how much space is required and so and so before asking your permission to continue.

70
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,310
But now that we've given it permission it will go ahead and start updating every piece of software on

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,520
the system or download the required packages unpack them install them and remove the old versions automatically

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,170
for every single piece of software on the entire system that was installed using the repositories.

73
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,070
This is an incredibly powerful automated system and this is really the beauty of using a package manager.

74
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,310
You don't have to go to the Web site and download manually each piece each new package like you might

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,960
have to do on Windows or Mac.

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,980
We've got to download the new installer or click for updates on each different piece of software.

77
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,970
Now all you have to do is want to upgrade upgrade everything that was installed through the repositories

78
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,360
will be upgraded to the newest version levels which helps you with security.

79
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,800
It helps you with having the most modern features and it's just absolutely.

80
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,220
And also if you use Krumm you can schedule this stuff to happen on a regular basis as well so that's

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,340
a useful thing to bear in mind.

82
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,390
Now this might take a varying amount of time depending upon how long it's been since since we've upgraded

83
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,950
our software and because I haven't actually done it on this virtual machines it will take quite a while.

84
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,610
So I'm going to do is I'm going to cut the video here and come back when it is done.

85
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,540
And just like that into commands.

86
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,590
All the software on our system has been upgraded and we can actually see that the Firefox logo has been

87
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,170
updated to look a whole lot more epic.

88
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,180
So notice how the system also didn't need to reboot all the software that we've installed that the repositories

89
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,310
has been upgraded and it's ready to go.

90
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,240
So all we had to do was update the package list using sudo apt get update and then once we updated it

91
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,460
or waited it was sudo apt get upgrade and then we upgraded all the software to the new versions.

92
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,020
So do know that sometimes you will need to reboot your system when you do these updates but this is

93
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,390
kind of unusual but sometimes it will need to happen.

94
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,170
But it's important to note that you should always update your cache before you perform an upgrade and

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,640
make sure that the upgrade occurs using the correct software versions and everything is updated uniformly.

96
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,730
So to update your cache you've run sudo apt get update and what this will do is it will download the

97
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,940
most updated versions of the package lists from the two servers into your cache that is stored on your

98
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,610
computer.

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,080
So in order to do that you need to have an internet connection.

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,400
But once you've updated your cache by downloading the most updated package lists you can upgrade all

101
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,030
of the software on your system using sudo apt get upgrade.

102
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,480
And what this will do is it will make the package manager look at all the software that is currently

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,460
on your system and compare it to what is available in the package lists and then the package manager

104
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,180
will automatically download and upgrade all the different packages that can be downloaded in order to

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,520
update your system to the most up to date level so this will download any new versions of packages that

106
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,090
remove old versions it'll download any new required dependencies.

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,560
And this just helps you know increase your system security.

108
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,980
It helps give you maximum functionality and it's all round just fantastic but something that you need

109
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,300
to bear in mind is that you need to update the cache before you upgrade because otherwise you'll be

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,250
upgrading all your software to lock the most up to date versions and you want to be able to update your

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,500
software to update versions in order to do that you need uptodate package lists so to update those lets

112
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,110
you update your cash and then when you've updated your cache you can operate your software.

113
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,910
So bear that in mind.

114
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,030
Always update your cache before you upgrade your software.

115
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,500
Another important thing to bear in mind here is that you can only upgrade software that was installed

116
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,870
through the repositories.

117
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,050
OK that is possible on a Gonu Linux system like we did in the previous videos where we modified the

118
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,030
ls command.

119
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,580
You can download packages manually extract them and compile them and install them yourself.

120
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,280
But because that process doesn't happen through the repositories and package manager you lose the ability

121
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,540
to keep them up to date like we are doing here.

122
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,900
So therefore if you can download a package from a web site and you can also get it from the absentee

123
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,320
repositories make sure to get it from the repositories because then you can make sure that it's up to

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,590
date.

125
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,820
Make sure you always have the best features available.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,810
Using this automated process so as of now we've discussed how to search for software had to update caches

127
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,080
and how to upgrade software.

128
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,760
But we haven't discussed had to actually install new software.

129
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,660
Well with all the understanding that you have now that's actually going to be really easy for you so

130
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,760
I'll save that little gem for the next video.
