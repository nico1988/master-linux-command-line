Hello you beautiful people are welcome to this section of the course.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,250
All about how to install and manage software on a Linux computer.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,840
Now Linux is an open source operating system and the great thing about that is that there are around

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,530
the world millions and millions of software developers who are creating software and all kinds of fantastic

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,160
stuff and making it available for free for people to download.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,710
So that's pretty cool that means we can benefit from that a little bit.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,150
Now Lileks has some amazing ways for you to gain access to this software.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,530
I mean this section I'm going to show you how to do it.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,920
So in the section you're going to start off with a lot of what Open-Source actually means.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,190
Are you going to show we're going to show you how you can see actual source code for some commands that

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,220
you've already seen in the course and then you'll learn how to use the software repositories to search

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,920
for and install new software.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,190
Keep that software up to date and also had to remove it when you no longer need it.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,990
So we're going to show you the whole package.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,930
Now usually when talking about software management on Linux courses just tell you into this command

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,280
and this command and this command with union you just got to memorize it which is useful and all but

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,920
it never really shows you you know the meaning behind it or leaves you feeling like you actually understand

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,900
what you're doing and why you're using a certain command.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,670
So in this section you're not only going to understand what commands to run you're also understand how

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,070
your software manager is working under the hood to help you install update and manage software in your

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,830
new Linux system.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,940
So by the end of the section you have a wonderfully in-depth and practical understanding of software

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,490
managers and you also have the practical know how to get more shiny new toys to play with than you can

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,070
possibly imagine.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,840
So for all the good stuff I'll see you in the next video.
