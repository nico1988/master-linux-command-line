00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,240
你好，漂亮的人欢迎你们来这一节课程。
Hello you beautiful people are welcome to this section of the course.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,250
所有关于如何在Linux计算机上安装和管理软件的内容。
All about how to install and manage software on a Linux computer.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,840
现在Linux是一个开放源码的操作系统，其中最棒的一点是
Now Linux is an open source operating system and the great thing about that is that there are around

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,530
世界上数以百万计的软件开发人员正在创建软件和各种奇妙的
the world millions and millions of software developers who are creating software and all kinds of fantastic

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,160
并免费提供给人们下载。
stuff and making it available for free for people to download.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,710
这是相当酷的，这意味着我们可以从中获益一点点。
So that's pretty cool that means we can benefit from that a little bit.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,150
现在，Lilek有一些令人惊叹的方法可以让您访问该软件。
Now Lileks has some amazing ways for you to gain access to this software.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,530
我的意思是这一节我要教你怎么做。
I mean this section I'm going to show you how to do it.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,920
因此，在这一节中，您将从很多开源的实际含义开始。
So in the section you're going to start off with a lot of what Open-Source actually means.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,190
您是否打算向您展示我们将如何查看某些命令的实际源代码，这些命令
Are you going to show we're going to show you how you can see actual source code for some commands that

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,220
您已经在本课程中看到过，然后您将学习如何使用软件存储库进行搜索
you've already seen in the course and then you'll learn how to use the software repositories to search

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,920
用于并安装新软件。
for and install new software.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,190
保持该软件为最新版本，并在不再需要时将其删除。
Keep that software up to date and also had to remove it when you no longer need it.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,990
因此，我们将向您展示整个包。
So we're going to show you the whole package.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,930
现在，通常在谈论Linux课程上的软件管理时，只需告诉您以下命令
Now usually when talking about software management on Linux courses just tell you into this command

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,280
这个命令和这个命令与Union一起使用，您只需要记住它，这是很有用的，而且除了
and this command and this command with union you just got to memorize it which is useful and all but

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,920
它从来不会让你真正知道它背后的意思，也不会让你觉得你真的明白了
it never really shows you you know the meaning behind it or leaves you feeling like you actually understand

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,900
您在做什么，以及为什么要使用某个命令。
what you're doing and why you're using a certain command.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,670
因此，在本节中，您不仅将了解要运行哪些命令，还将了解如何
So in this section you're not only going to understand what commands to run you're also understand how

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,070
您的软件经理正在暗中工作，帮助您在中安装、更新和管理软件
your software manager is working under the hood to help you install update and manage software in your

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,830
新的Linux系统。
new Linux system.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,940
因此，在这一节结束时，您将对软件有一个非常深入和实用的理解
So by the end of the section you have a wonderfully in-depth and practical understanding of software

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,490
经理和你也有实际的知识，如何得到比你能玩的更多闪亮的新玩具。
managers and you also have the practical know how to get more shiny new toys to play with than you can

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,070
可以想象。
possibly imagine.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,840
所以，对于所有的好东西，我会在下一个视频中见到你。
So for all the good stuff I'll see you in the next video.
