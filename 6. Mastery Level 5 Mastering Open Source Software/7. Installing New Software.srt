1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,700
So in the last few videos we've been learning a whole lot about our package manager and how it works.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,120
And we learned about the cash and what it's for we've learned about how to update the cash and how to

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,410
upgrade all of the software on our system to the newest versions using the package manager which is

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,370
all super awesome stuff.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,080
But how can we install new packages.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,130
That's what we want to know.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,640
Well with the background that you've gained from the previous videos install it will be really easy

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,360
to understand and not just something that you have to memorize.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,270
And by the end of this video you will know how to install new software from the command line.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,810
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,550
OK.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,900
So whether we know that our cash and system are fully up to date let's go ahead and install some new

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,620
software.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,840
So let's say that I've heard of a program called X eyes and X always apparently makes a window with

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,830
some funny eyes pop up that follow your mouse cursor around the screen.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,230
And I think this is interesting and I want to install it.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,730
So do that first we need to know what package the excise program comes in.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,390
So let's search the cache for it the way that we do that is we do apt cache search for excise and it

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,820
will give us every package that has something to do with excise.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,150
And we've heard of this package called x 11 apps let's say and we like ah that's the one I've heard

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,280
of let me go and have a closer look at it.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,010
So we do we do apt Cash show x 11 apps.

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,490
OK.

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,410
So you give it the name of the package here and that will give us a bunch of information.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,520
But let's just clear the screen and pipe that through less so we get a bit of a closer look.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,200
OK.

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,600
And when we open this here we can see that actually that we get a lot of information about the package.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,630
But down here in the description it says that this package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,320
applications that ship with the X Window System including And it will tell us that we've got something

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,330
tools for manipulating bitmap images something for a tool that tells you when you have new e-mail and

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,690
so on.

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,600
And then there's a one here called X eyes and an excise is a demo program in which a pair of eyes track

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,590
the pointer.

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,790
So that's what we want and we realize that actually we want to have a look at this is also another one

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,560
called X man which is a manual page browser which you know might be useful as well.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,390
OK so now we're pretty convinced we want to install the x 11 apps package.

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,380
How can we do that.

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,420
Well it's actually really easy to do if we get out of less is just when we clear the screen or we've

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,150
got to do type sudo apt get install X 11 apps so we just enter the name of the package.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,430
Now notice that we're using apt get a gap to install the package because we want our package manager

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,400
to get data from the internet and not just from the local cache.

42
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,060
And we also passed the package name that we wanted to install which um because we want to install X

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,660
and iPhone apps we typed x 11 apps in there when we press enter.

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,120
We see that it would ask for a password which we enter and then the package manager is going to go ahead

45
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,590
and install the new packages with many dependencies that are actually required.

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,580
Now sometimes it might ask for your permission if it needs to install a lot but because its only installing

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,540
about 600 kilobytes it was like Here let me just go ahead and install it.

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,970
It has a provision for something that so small OK but that has nothing to do the package is installed

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,080
and its as simple as that now.

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,280
X 11 apps is a precompiled package also known as a binary package.

51
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,090
Now most packages are binary packages which means that the code that make the software has been precompiled

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,500
and ready to go beforehand so you don't have to do any of that configure make and make install stuff

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,870
that we did a few videos ago yourself.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,870
Like I just installed the package from the repositories and you're done.

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,280
And what's better the package will also be tracked for updates so you can update the package if new

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,570
updates are made available.

57
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,670
How awesome is that.

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,470
Now let's try out our new software.

59
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,860
So we wanted to use the x is program.

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,300
So if we just play the screen and type x is in there and press enter.

61
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,800
You'll see that we get these funny googly eyes pop up on the screen that follow our most surrounds if

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,660
I put the most down here.

63
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,720
What was it got scared away the eyes if I pop him up here then it will follow around properly not as

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,460
fluidly as I'd like but I'm going to put that down to us running this in a virtual machine.

65
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,200
But if like you know it does follow a whole lot nicer.

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,850
But that's pretty cool right now.

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,800
The awesome thing is the way that you wouldn't you install will come with its own man page self-disclose

68
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,270
excise here.

69
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,970
Then if I do man X eyes you'll see that he's actually now also got a manual page installed that says

70
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,930
follow the mouse X demo.

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,030
And it's also got some options.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,960
You can even control the excise program from the command line and we can see here that there is a there

73
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,700
is an option here called Center which allows you to choose a different color for the center of the eyes.

74
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,720
So for example if we do excise thinking at the center option and tell it I think it's two dashes center

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,300
blue upslope maybe just one maybe just one dash.

76
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,840
There we go.

77
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,280
Now the center the ice is blue and I want you to know is here is the way that look when you open the

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
exercise program graphically.

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,840
You don't have the option to change the color of the eyes.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,250
Right.

81
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,560
But from the command line you can change that and a whole lot more.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,060
So this is highlighting for you just how powerful the command line is and how it does give you more

83
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,450
abilities than is possible with a graphical editor.

84
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,420
And if you can edit the color of googly eyes then tell me what really is the point of having a computer.

85
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,880
Now the S11 apps package came with quite a few other pieces of software inside one of which is called

86
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,040
X man which you might find useful.

87
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,600
Now X man is a graphical window for looking at the manual pages.

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,920
So if we get rid of excise here and close it and then we type X man we'll see a window pop up over here.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,780
Now you can search the man pages using this if we click on manual page right there and open up a bigger

90
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:45,430
window and if we click on the on the options at the top here if we hold down the mouse button it shows

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,910
the menu to hold down the mouse button and you'll see this dropdown menu.

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,170
Then if you go on search and let go of the mouse that is if we click the search thing.

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,170
And now we can search for something in here.

94
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,520
So this is for example if we take a look at LS and we try to look at it as a manual page then it'll

95
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,810
open up the LS manual page and you can browse through it here.

96
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,980
So this is a great more I guess graphical way of taking a look at the manual pages than you do with

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,690
the command line.

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,870
But you know which I guess it just makes it look pretty and you can also look at the sections so you

99
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,350
can look in user commands and you can see all of the user commands here.

100
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,600
And if I wanted to look at let's say the the address to line command or just click on that and it would

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,530
open up so it's a nice graphical way of browsing through the manual so that's something you can play

102
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,600
around with if you like.

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,020
And one thing I also want to highlight is how by installing one package the x 11 apps package will actually

104
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,290
installed multiple different pieces of software which is super cool.

105
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,010
And we didn't have to do any compiling we didn't have to do any configuring or had to do was make sure

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:53,110
that our package list was up to date using sudo apt get updates and then or wait to do them whooshes

107
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,250
sudo apt get install and then a package name and that's it.

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,480
We can we can rest assured that we've got the most up to date version of that package and it's also

109
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,350
it's also we didn't even have to find out if the package was suitable for our computers architecture

110
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:13,220
and decide between you know 386 or am 64 that was all catered for automatically which is awesome.

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,080
But all of the software in that package was pre-compiled.

112
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,690
So what if we wanted to utilize the freedoms that free software gives us and access the source code

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,400
for a package and modify it while accessing the source code from the repositories it's also very easy.

114
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,700
But there are a few edits that you need to make.

115
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,260
So for all that freedom goodness I'll see you in the next video.
