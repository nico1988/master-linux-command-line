00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,080
大家好，美丽的人们，欢迎收看这段视频，我们将在这里讨论如何
Hello you beautiful people and welcome to this video where we're going to be talking about how you can

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,330
下载软件包的源代码。
download the source code for packages.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,150
所以目前我们所能做的就是下载并安装预编译的二进制软件包，但是我们
So at the minute all we've been able to do is download and install precompiled binary packages but we're

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,570
感兴趣的是我们如何才能获得源代码，这样我们就可以自由地行使
interested in how we might be able to go about getting source code so we can exercise the freedoms that

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,900
自由软件给了我们。
free software gives us.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,370
要做到这一点实际上是一个非常简单的过程，或者作为管理员要做的事情。
And it's actually a very easy process in order to do so or what to do is as an administrator.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:29,740
因此，使用sudo命令在natto中打开劈开，在c劈开apt劈开上打开文档列表文件。
So with the sudo command open up in natto the slash at c slash apt slash sourses doc list file.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,950
好的，现在在这里，当您输入密码时，您将打开一个配置文件，即包
Ok now in here when you enter your password you're going to be opening up a configuration file the package

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,750
管理器使用来确定它下载的存储库和程序包文件。
manager uses to determine which repositories and which package files it downloads.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,370
换句话说，它下载的是哪个源。
In other words which source is it downloads.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,240
好的，我们在这里要做的是，您会注意到有几行以Debb source开头
OK so what we're going to do in here is you'll notice that there are lines that start with Debb source

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,770
或者Debb破折号S或C，这些行前面有一个散列。
or Debb dash S or C and those lines have a hash in front of them.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,630
我想要做的是删除适当行上的所有散列。
What I want to do is I want to just delete all those hashes on those appropriate lines.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,060
这将激活您的包管理器能够下载的功能
And what this will do is it will activate the ability for your package manager to be able to download

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,490
源代码，默认情况下处于停用状态，基本上只是为了节省效率。
source code which is deactivated by default just to save efficiency basically.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,930
所以我们要去看“还没做过的事”。
So we're going to Haven't done that.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
我要按0中的Ctrl保存文件，或者按X的X Ctrl退出。
I'm going to press control in 0 to save the file or press X control of X to exit.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,820
那么我们所做的就是我们已经对软件包管理器说，嘿，为什么不继续下载
So then what we've done is we've said to the package manager hey why don't you go ahead and download

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,540
软件包列出了包含源代码的列表。
the package lists that contain source code.

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,260
好的，但是为了能够把这些东西放进缓存，我们必须更新我们的现金。
Ok but to be able to get those things in the cache we've got to update our cash.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,390
好的，我所做的就是sudo apt获取更新，它将继续并开始下载所有源代码
OK so all I was do sudo apt get updates and it's going to go ahead and start downloading all the source

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,740
包裹在这里。
packages here.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,010
因此您可以看到，这是在将所有源包安装到缓存中。
So you can see that this is is installing all the source packages into cache.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,630
这是一件非常有用的事情，因为现在我们可以了，我们几乎已经准备好能够下载源代码了。
This is a very useful thing because now we can we're almost ready to be able to download source code.

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,210
好的，在我们可以下载源代码之前，我们需要再安装一个软件包，以便安装
OK so before we can download source code we need to install one more package which is so to get installed

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,540
将是DASH DEV包DP K.G.DASH DEV。
is going to be the package dash dev package the DP K.G. dash dev.

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,860
你安装了，当它问你的时候，你输入YES，然后我们就到了，我们已经成功了，现在就要开始了
You install that you type yes when it asks you and there we are we've managed to now it's going to go

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,760
然后下载并解压缩该软件包，现在我们可以继续安装源代码了。
ahead and download and unpack that package and now we can go ahead and install source code.

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,830
从字面上看就是这么简单。
It's literally that simple.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,500
好的，我们一直在摆弄我转移到桌面上的消费税包裹，我们一直在摆弄
OK so we've been messing around with the excise package I made over to the desktop and we've been messing

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,660
带着消费税包裹到处跑。
around with the excise package.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,590
我们怎样才能弄到锻炼套餐或锻炼计划的源代码呢？
How can we get the source code for the for the excise package or the exercise program.

33
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,160
它包含在x11应用程序包中。
Well it's contained in the x 11 apps package.

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,820
因此，如果我们使用sudo apt get，并且我们过去是正确安装的，那么我们确实可以正确安装X11应用程序。
So if we do sudo apt get and we used to do install right we do install X 11 apps right.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,140
这就是获取预编译二进制版本的方法。
That's how you'd get the pre-compiled binary version.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,600
但是如果你想要得到源代码，你就会发现，它有点像是，而不是安装，只要把源代码放进去就行了
But if you want to get the source code it sort of instead of install just put source and you'll see

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,280
它会继续下载这些包以包含源代码。
that it goes ahead and downloads these packages to contain source code.

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,200
现在，我们实际上可以继续使用CD输入这些内容。
Now we can actually go ahead and enter these using CD.

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,520
因此，如果我们将CD放入包中并四处看看，我们可以看到这里有一个文件夹，用于存放X Eyes和
So if we CD into the package and take a look around we can see there's is a folder here for X eyes and

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:00,470
如果我们看一下X Eyes，这里会看到CD X Eyes，我们已经获得了该练习的源代码
if we take a look in X eyes a CD X eyes will be seen here that we've got the source code for the exercise

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,610
程序，所以您可以看到我们已经有了配置文件，可以用来配置新的C编译器。
program so you can see we've got our config file that we can can use to configure our new C-compiler.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,840
但是我们现在感兴趣的是这个附加部分Dotsie，它实际上是
But what we're interested in right now is this excise Dotsie which is actually the source code for the

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
练习程序，我们可以在这里看一看，并阅读练习程序的源代码。
exercise program and we can take a look in here and read the source code for the exercise program.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,960
从字面上看就是这么简单。
It's literally that simple.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,400
好的。
OK.

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,380
我们所要做的就是继续更改我们的劈开ETSI劈开运营劈开来源。
All we had to do was go ahead and change our slash ETSI slash ops slash sources.

47
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,380
Dart去年秋天在这里只需取消注释前面有散列的所有行
Dart last fall and in here just uncomment all the lines that had that had a hash in front of them for

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,450
黛布线人。
Debb source.

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,060
这些都是允许您实际下载源代码以查看和评论所有内容的存储库
And those are the repositories that allow you to actually download source code to view and comment all

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,110
然后使用sudo apt更新您的缓存，然后获取更新，然后下载所有新的
of those and then update your cache using sudo apt get updates then what you've downloaded all the new

51
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:50,930
LESS我们要做的就是安装IS，安装DP K.G.dev包，然后您就可以进入那里了
less We've got to do is install the is install the DP K.G. dev package and then you get to go in there

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,140
从现在开始，如果你想下载任何源代码，你所要做的就是sudo apt get source
from now on if you ever want to download any source code and all you've got to do is sudo apt get source

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,420
然后是包名。
and then a package name.

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,100
好的。
OK.

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,680
这就是您需要知道的全部内容，以便能够下载和玩弄源代码。
And that is all you need to know in order to be able to download and play around with source code.

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,730
但是您应该记住的一件事是，如果您进入源代码包中，并且您实际上
But one thing that you should bear in mind is that if you go into the source code packages and you actually

57
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,930
编译它们您将失去安装它们的能力，这样您将失去保持更新的能力
compile them you'll lose the ability to install them that way you'll lose the ability to keep them updated

58
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,070
和你的套餐经理在一起。
with your package manager.

59
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,580
因此，如果您可以选择通过软件包管理器安装软件包，也可以选择从
So therefore if you have the choice to install a package through the package manager or install it from

60
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,300
源代码请确保您通过包管理器和存储库(而不是通过存储库)安装它
source make sure that you install it through the package manager and through the repositories rather

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,530
而不是自己编辑。
than compiling it yourself.

62
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,440
但是，这是一种非常酷的方式，可以继续查看代码是如何工作的，也许还可以合并
But this is a really cool way to be able to go ahead and take a look at how code works and maybe incorporate

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,670
把它放在你的项目里。
it in your projects.
