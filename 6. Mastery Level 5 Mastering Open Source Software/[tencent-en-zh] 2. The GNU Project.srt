1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,590
你好，你们这些漂亮的人。
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,110
现在，吸引您使用Linux的一个关键因素可能是开源软件的想法。
Now one key thing that probably brought you to work with Linux is the idea of open source software.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,220
但是这个词到底是什么意思呢。
But what does that term really mean.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,470
在这段视频中，我们将讨论新项目以及它对软件的实际意义
Well in this video we're going to talk about the new project and what it actually means for software

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,350
开放源码和整个开放源码运动的历史。
to be open source and the history of the whole open source movement.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,470
所以，让我们继续下去，开始吧。
So let's go ahead and get into it.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:19,860
好的。
OK.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,330
因此，我们可能首先需要了解的是，当我们听到这个词时，Linux实际上是什么
So the first thing that we probably need to understand is what Linux actually is when we hear the word

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,430
我们可能会认为我们使用的整个操作系统就是Linux操作系统。
Linux we probably think of a whole operating system that we use as being the Linux operating system.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,710
现在，令人惊讶的是，事实并非如此，Linux实际上只是整个体系中的一部分
Now surprisingly this is actually not the case and Linux is actually just one of the pieces of the whole

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,840
操作系统是内核。
operating system the kernel.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,290
所以让我解释一下。
So let me explain.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,060
9月1日1983年9月，一个叫理查德·斯托尔曼的人宣布，他将开始
On Sept. 27 the September in 1983 a person called Richard Stallman announced that he was going to begin

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,900
开发一个类似于Unix操作系统但完全免费的操作系统
developing a operating system that was similar to the Unix operating system but made of entirely free

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,890
软件。
software.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,710
现在这个操作系统被称为新的操作系统，拼写为g和U，它代表Ganu is
Now the operating system was called the new operating system spelled g and U which stands for Ganu is

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,870
而不是他们喜欢称之为递归缩写的Unix。
not Unix which they like to call a recursive acronym.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,610
好的。
OK.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,520
1984年1月，理查德·斯托尔曼(Richard Stallman)辞去了人工智能实验室(AI Lab)的工作
Now in nine in January 1984 Richard Stallman quit his job in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,820
麻省理工学院让麻省理工学院全职致力于GANU项目的目标是创造
Massachusetts Institute of Technology so MIT to work on the Ganu project full time in the aims of creating

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,660
由完全自由的软件组成的操作系统。
an operating system made of completely free software.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,360
现在，术语自由软件实际上指的是软件给予用户的几个自由，而不是
Now the term free software actually refers to several freedoms that the software gives the user rather

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,090
而不是像金钱一样自由。
than being free as in money.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,080
因此，当你听到“自由软件”这个词时，想想言论自由，而不是免费午餐。
So when you hear the term free software think free speech and not free lunch.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,060
现在，这些自由是第一次。
Now these freedoms are the first.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,990
第一个是出于任何目的随心所欲地运行程序的自由。
First one is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,680
第一个自由，第二个自由是研究程序如何工作并对其进行更改的自由
The first freedom the second freedom is the freedom to study how the program works and change it so

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,630
它可以按照你的意愿进行计算。
that it does the computing as you wish.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,860
这就是一个人的自由。
Which is what freedom one is.

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,500
好的，自由一是程序会做你想做的事。
OK freedom one is that the program will do what you wish.

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,510
对我来说，自由就是研究程序是如何工作的自由，并对其进行更改，使其按照您的方式运行
Freedom to me is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does as you

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,230
祝愿。
wish.

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,340
现在，访问程序的源代码是实现这一点的前提条件。
Now access to the source code for a program is a precondition for this.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,620
你不能研究一个程序是如何工作的，你可以看它的代码。
You can't study how a program works and you can look at its code.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
因此，能够访问源代码是自由号的前提条件。
So having access to the source code is a precondition for freedom number.

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,600
第三个自由是重新分发软件副本的自由，这样您就可以像他们说的那样
The third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies of the software so that you can as they say

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,140
帮助您的邻居，而不是以前的自由是分发修改版本的副本的自由
help your neighbor and freedom not before is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified version

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,720
你的软件。
of your software.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,230
如果你修改它，你可以将这个愿望重新分配给帮助他人的自由3号。
If you modify it you can redistribute that Wishings to freedom number 3 of helping other people.

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,660
而是由和。
But by and.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,250
显然，通过这样做，您可以让整个社区有机会从您的更改中受益。
Apparently by doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,190
同样，访问源代码是实现这一点的前提条件。
And again access to the source code is a precondition for this.

43
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,760
好的，所以如果您想修改软件并重新分发它，您需要有权访问源代码
OK so if you want to modify software and redistribute it you need to have access to the source code

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,620
以便能够改变它。
in order to be able to change it.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,960
现在有了一个许可证，它合法地向软件用户提供这些自由，被称为
Now there's a license that legally provides a user of software with these freedoms and is known as the

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,710
皮划艇公共执照或GPL。
canoe public license or the GPL.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,250
现在有多个版本的Gonu公共许可证或GPL，但在录制GPL时
Now are several versions of the Gonu public license or the GPL but at the time of recording the GPL

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,790
版本3是最现代的版本。
version 3 is the most modern version.

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,590
但是在1991年，新的系统几乎完工，但是新的操作仍然缺少一个部分。
But in 1991 the new system was almost finished but there was still one part missing from the new operating

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,510
这是一个重要的组成部分。
system and it was an important part.

51
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,280
这最后一个部分是每个操作系统的主要部分，它被称为内核。
This final piece is a major part of every operating system and it's called the kernel.

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,870
内核负责分配计算机硬件上的资源，这些资源由
The kernel is responsible for allocating the resources on the computer's hardware that is required by

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,120
正在运行的软件，因此它是计算机硬件和应用程序之间的接口层
the software that is running so it's the interface layer between the computers hardware and the applications

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,910
它正在运行。
that it's running.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,760
好的，1991年的这个时候，一个叫莱纳斯·托瓦尔兹的人正在大学完成他的MFC论文
OK now at this time in 1991 a man called like Linus Torvalds was completing his MFC thesis at the University

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,990
作为这项工作的一部分，Lenas发明了一个类似Unix的内核，称为Linux，它
of Helsinki in Finland and as part of this work Lenas invented a Unix like kernel called Linux and it

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,780
以他自己的名字命名为Linux。
was called Linux after his own name.

58
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,930
但是Unix世界中的所有东西都是以X结尾的。
But everything in the Unix world kind of ends in an X..

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,670
所以Linux在下一步就结束了。
So Linux ending in the next.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Linux可以吗？
Is Linux OK.

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,940
在一位同学邀请维特去看理查德·斯托尔曼的演讲后，
And after being VEIDT after being invited by a fellow student to go see a talk by Richard Stallman who

62
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,360
在Lenas发布linux内核的第2版时，他也是一位著名的活动家。
is also a prominent activist at the time Lenas released the Linux kernel under the version 2 of the

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,140
新的公共许可证或GPL，从而使Linux内核成为免费软件，因此Fang对Linux内核来说也是如此
new Public License or GPL thereby making the Linux kernel free software so Fang's to the Linux kernel

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,140
新的操作系统是完整的，并且是完全可运行的操作系统，由完全免费的
the new operating system was complete and and was fully runnable operating system made of entirely free

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,240
软件。
software.

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,320
有了我们之前谈到的这四个自由，它开始流行起来，实际上是Linux
With those four freedoms we talked about before and it began to gain popularity and it in fact the Linux

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,980
今天在Android设备甚至Chrome OS上使用的内核，所以如果你曾经听到人们说哦
kernel that is used today on on Android devices and even Chrome OS so if you ever hear people say oh

68
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,550
Android运行Linux或Chrome OS运行Linux，他们的意思是使用Linux内核进行接口
Android runs Linux or Chrome OS runs Linux what they mean is they use the Linux kernel to interface

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,750
位于计算机的软件层和硬件层之间。
between the software layer and the hardware layer of your computer.

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,450
但是因为linux内核是最后一块，所以它得到了很大的关注，睡觉
But because the Linux kernel was the final piece it kind of got a whole lot of attention and the rest

71
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,160
在新的操作系统中所做的工作都被遗忘了。
of the work that went into the new operating system was kind of forgotten.

72
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,150
而是因为当我们运行像Buntu或任何其他Linux发行版这样的发行版时，我们运行的实际上是
But because what we run when we run a distribution like a buntu or any other Linux distribution is actually

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
新的操作系统和Linux内核。
the new operating system and the Linux kernel.

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,110
有人建议，为了给团队项目以信任，而不是仅仅给整个项目打电话
It was recommended that in order to give the group project its credit instead of just calling the whole

75
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,050
Linux的东西，我们应该叫它新的。
thing Linux we should call it new.

76
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,650
加上Linux。
Plus Linux.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,320
事实上，有一个名为you name命令的命令，它实际上会告诉您大量的信息
In fact there is a command called the you name command that will actually tell you loads of information

78
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,800
关于您的计算机的信息，例如它有什么硬件，它正在运行什么操作系统。
about your computer such as what hardware it has and what operating system that it's running.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,430
因此，如果您使用o选项在命令中运行该单元，它将告诉您您的操作系统。
So if you run the unit in command with the o option it'll tell you your operating systems.

80
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,560
如果我们运行它，我们可以看到我们可以获得GANU劈开LINUX作为操作系统。
If we run that we see that we can we get Ganu slash Linux as the operating system.

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,590
听起来很酷，对吧。
Sounds pretty cool right.

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,540
好的，了解了历史之后，我们现在知道了到目前为止您在
OK so with that history understood we now know pretty much all of the commands of you so far in the

83
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,480
课程(如ls命令、find命令等)都是新项目的一部分，并给出
course such as the ls command of the find command and so on are all part of the new project and to give

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,930
用户可以享受自由软件提供的自由。
the users the freedoms that free software provides.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,190
源代码需要可供阅读，因为访问源代码是以下各项的前提条件
The source code needs to be available to read because access to the source code is a precondition for

86
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,300
这些自由是对的。
those freedoms right.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,160
因此，换句话说，该软件必须是开源的。
So in other words the software must be open source.

88
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,900
好的，所以源代码必须是开放的，才能访问。
Ok so the source code must be open be accessible.

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,370
它是开源的。
It's open source.

90
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,640
那么，为什么我们要看一下我们的计算机运行的代码。
So how come we have a look at the code that our computer runs.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,410
实际上，在独木舟项目的官方网站Ganu.com org上都可以免费访问。
Well it's actually all freely accessible on the canoe project's official Web site Ganu dot org.

92
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:06,410
所以，如果我在这里打开一个Firefox浏览器，当它启动后，我们就转到新的.org。
So if I just open up a Firefox browser here and when that boots up we head over to the new dot org.

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,090
我们可以看到我在说什么，所以我们就在这里。
We'll be able to see what I'm talking about so here we are.

94
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,040
有Firefox。
Has Firefox.

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,260
让我们转到Ganu dot org并按Enter键。
Let's go to Ganu dot org and press enter.

96
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,280
我们走吧。
There we go.

97
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,250
所以你可以更详细地阅读自由软件思想背后的哲学，你可以
So you can read all about the philosophy behind the Free Software ideology in more detail and you can

98
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,840
看这里，它在告诉您在这里尝试新的Linux。
see here it's telling you to try new Linux here.

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,350
但是如果您转到软件部分，如果我们单击此处的软件并向下滚动到某个部件
But if you head over to the software section if we click on software here and scroll down to a part

100
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,660
上面写着都是好的新包裹。
that says all good new packages.

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,440
这里写着组织新包裹。
Here it says org new packages.

102
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,240
您可以在这里看到，这里基本上链接到运行在其上的每一段代码
You can you can see here that there's every This basically links to every bit of code that is run on

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,510
一个包含Linux内核本身的自由软件版本的新系统，我们可以在
a new system including a free software version of the Linux kernel itself which we can find under the

104
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,660
Linux lb.软件包显示我们是Linux 1b..
Linux lb. package say we are Linux lb..

105
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,520
好的，这就是软件包，这是包含所有源代码的完整可下载文件夹
OK that's the that's the package that's the full downloadable folder that contains all of the source

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,850
Linux内核本身的V代码。
code for V for the Linux kernel itself.

107
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,980
这真是太棒了。
That's pretty awesome.

108
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:07,300
现在，对于您到目前为止已经运行的所有命令，这是ls命令grep find，不管它是什么。
Now for all the commands that you've run so far this is the ls command grep find whatever it might be.

109
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,390
好的。
OK.

110
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,310
您可以在核心utils包下找到它们，我们会叫您Tell。
You can find those under the core utils package that we'll call you tell.

111
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,780
好的。
OK.

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,200
所以你可以在那里找到你告诉我们的电话包裹里的东西。
So that's where you can find the stuff in there in that call you tell us package.

113
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,880
在下一个视频中，我们将下载call utos包，对其进行修改并安装新版本
And in the next video we're going to download the call utos package modify it and install a new version

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,250
将ls命令发送到我们的计算机，这将是非常令人兴奋的。
of the ls command to our computer which is going to be super super exciting.

115
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,830
但首先让我们快速回顾一下我们在这段视频中学到了什么。
But first let's just take a quick recap of what we've learned in this video.

116
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,150
好的。
OK.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,410
在这段视频中，您了解到Richard Stallman开始开发新的操作系统
So in this video you learned about Richard Stallman beginning the development of the new operating system

118
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,400
在1983年，当时的想法是创建一个完全由自由软件组成的类似Unix的操作系统。
in 1983 and the idea was to create a Unix like operating system that was made of entirely free software.

119
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,800
你会发现，当我们说自由软件时，我们指的是为用户提供特定功能的软件
And you learn that when we say the words free software we mean software that provides users with certain

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,520
自由所以想想言论自由，而不是免费午餐。
freedoms so think of free speech rather than free lunch.

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,750
好的。
OK.

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,310
第四，自由软件给了用户四种自由
Now the Fourth there are four freedoms that the free the free software gives the users so gives the

123
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,600
用户可以出于任何目的随心所欲地运行程序。
users the ability to run programs as they wish for any purpose.

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,740
它使用户能够研究程序是如何工作的，并将其更改为
It gives the users the ability to study how a program works and change it so it does the computing as

125
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,230
他们希望并且能够访问源代码是实现这一目标的前提条件，它使用户能够
they wish and access to source code is a precondition for that and it gives the users the ability to

126
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,910
免费分发他们得到的任何副本，这样他们就可以帮助其他人。
freely freely distribute any copies they get so that they can help other people.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,270
它还使用户能够分发他们创建的软件的修改版本
And it also gives the users the ability to distribute modified versions of the software that they create

128
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,490
其他人。
other people.

129
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,770
因此，这允许整个社区从用户所做的任何更改中受益。
So this allows the whole community to benefit from any changes that a user makes.

130
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,330
同样，访问源代码也是实现这一目标的前提条件。
And again access to source code is a precondition for that as well.

131
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,160
现在，这些自由被合法地提供给使用新的公共许可证或GPL的用户。
Now these freedoms are legally provided to users using the new Public License or the GPL.

132
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:47,320
正如我录制GPL的时候一样，GPL的第三版GPL版本3是最现代的
And as I as the time of recording the the third version of the GPL GPL version 3 is the most modern

133
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,650
许可版本和开放获取源代码是给予这些自由的前提条件。
version of the license and open access to the source code is a precondition for giving these freedoms.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,130
因此，当拥有可公开访问源代码的软件时，它被称为开源软件，这样您就可以
So when have software has openly accessible source code it is known as open source software so you can

135
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:07,180
说自由软件是开放源码的，但并不是所有的软件或不是所有的开放源码软件都是自由软件
say that free software is open source but not all soft or not all open source software is free software

136
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,010
因为虽然人们可能会让你看到源代码，但这并不意味着他们一定会给你
because while people might let you see the source code that doesn't mean they necessarily give you the

137
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,110
修改和分发它所需的自由。
freedoms required to modify and distribute it.

138
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,470
他们可能只会让你看到源代码，但是自由软件确实需要开源软件
They might just let you see the source code OK but the free software does does require open source software

139
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,380
因此，它以一种方式工作，而不是以另一种方式工作。
so it works one way but not the other.

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,150
你们也已经了解到，1991年，新项目几乎完工，但它有一个重要的缺失
And you've also learned that in 1991 the new project was almost finished but it had a important missing

141
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,650
它是内核，内核是操作系统的一部分。
piece which was the kernel and the kernel is the part of the operating system.

142
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,860
硬件和之间的接口根据软件从硬件分配资源
The interfaces between the hardware and allocates resources from the hardware depending upon what software

143
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,540
需要它。
requires it.

144
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,800
1991年，Linus Torvalds创建了他自己的内核版本，并将其命名为Linux内核并发布
And in 1991 Linus Torvalds created his own version of a kernel and called it the Linux kernel and released

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,600
1991年，它也在新的公共许可证版本下运行，从而使其成为自由软件。
it in 1991 under the new Public License version too thereby making it free software.

146
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,810
所以Linux内核是新操作系统的最后一块，现在两者倾向于协同工作。
So the Linux kernel was the final piece for the new operating system and now the two tend to work together.

147
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,480
因此，当您下载Buntu或下载任何其他类型的Linux发行版时，您实际上
So when you download a buntu or when you download any other type of Linux distribution what you're actually

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,050
下载是新的Plus Linux操作系统的一个版本。
downloading is a version of the new Plus Linux operating system.

149
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,180
因此，从今以后，我们不再只称它为Linux，我们将称它为新的Linux操作系统。
So henceforth we won't just call it Linux we'll call it the new Linux operating system.

150
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,010
好了，在接下来的视频中，既然我们理解了我们所理解的这一小段历史课程
OK so in the next video now that we understand this little bit of a history lesson we understand about

151
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,560
自由和开放源码软件的全部内容。
the freedoms and what open source software is all about.

152
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,940
我们将使用一些源代码。
We're going to play with some source code.

153
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,660
好的，我们将下载并查看一些核心命令的源代码。
OK we're going to download and take a look at some of the source code for some core commands.

154
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,020
修改他们的代码，并在我们的计算机上安装修改后的代码，看看他们的行为有何不同。
Modify their code and install that modified code on our computer and see how they behave differently.

155
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,410
所以这将是令人惊叹的，它将真正让你看到哪些开放源码的自由软件
So it's going to be amazing and it's going to really allow you to see what open source free software

156
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,260
都是关于。
is all about.

157
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,580
好了，我会在下一个视频中见到你。
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
