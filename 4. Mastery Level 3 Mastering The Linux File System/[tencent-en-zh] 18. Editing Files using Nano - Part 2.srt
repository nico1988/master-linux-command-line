1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,870
你好，你们这些漂亮的人。
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,810
欢迎回到我们关于如何使用Nano命令行文本编辑器获取工作的讨论
And welcome back to our discussion of how to use the Nano command line text editor to get your work

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,200
好了。
done.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,090
在上一个视频中，我们讨论了Nano拥有的一些选项，我们讨论了
So we were in the last video we were discussing some of the options that Nano has and we discussed the

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,090
右-O选项，读选项，WHERE是选项，我们得到了REPLACE选项。
Right-O option the read option the where is option and we got up to the replace option.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,570
因此，让我们实际使用Read Form选项再次读入生日文档文本。
So let's actually use the read form option to read in birthday doc text again.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,620
所以我们要说生日，点文本，你看，我们生日快乐。
So we're going to say birthday Dot text and you see that we've got happy birthday.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,110
再次读入文件。
Read into the file once again.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,400
我这样做的原因是我们现在可以使用REPLACE命令，您可以在这里看到
And the reason I've done that is so that we can now use the replace command and you can see here that

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,450
REPLACE命令(尽管此处是REPLACE选项)是通过按Ctrl和反斜杠激活的。
the replace command although replace option here is activated by pressing control and a backslash.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,360
现在我在键盘上找到了字母Zed旁边的反斜杠，但它可能在您的键盘上的任何位置
Now I find the backslash next to the letter Zed on my keyboard but it might be wherever that is on your

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,280
在您的计算机或键盘上。
on your computer or on your keyboard.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,710
好的。
OK.

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,060
所以新闻控制和反斜杠。
So the press control and backslash.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,180
现在它又问我想换什么。
And now it's asking me what I want to replace.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,950
所以我们换个生日吧。
So let's replace birthday.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,920
好的。
OK.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,040
我们要把它换成代码日。
And we're going to replace it with code day.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,370
当我按Enter键时，它现在将遍历找到单词生日的每个实例
And when I press Enter it's going to now go through each instance of where it found the word birthday

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,770
问问你要不要换掉它。
and ask if you want to replace it.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,640
现在你可以在底部看到它，这是因为我确实想要放置这个实例，我可以说，是的，我
Now you can see it on the bottom here is because I do want to place this instance I could say yes I

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,020
我可以说“不”，也可以说“全部”，或者我可以说“控制”，然后看看是否取消。
could say no or I could say all or I could say control and see for cancel.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,370
所以我们只需按下a键就可以将其全部替换掉。
So let's just press a to make it replace all.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,500
我们看到，生日的每一个例子都被单词code day取代了。
And we see that every instance of birthday has been replaced with the word code day.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,710
祝你代码日快乐，你这个漂亮的人。
So happy code day to you you beautiful person.

26
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,860
那就是替换文本，下一个就是剪切文本，剪切文本。
So that's replacing text what about cutting text cutting text is the next one.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,900
所以切割非常容易，你可以看到这里有这样一行字，写着“代码日快乐”。
So cutting is very easy you can see here we've got this line that says Happy code day.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,030
如果我按下Ctrl键和K键进行剪切，基本上就会删除该行，如果我想粘贴它的话。
If I press control and K to cut that basically deletes the line and if I want to paste that.

29
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,810
因此，基本上这就像是在日常电脑使用中剪切和粘贴一样。
So basically it's just like cutting and pasting just in your normal everyday computer use.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,860
所以如果我想把它剪下来，我按下Ctrl，你和我可以想做多少次就做多少次。
So if I want to uncut it I press control and you and I can do that as many times as I want.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,890
所以这是一个非常非常快乐的代码日。
So this is a very very happy code day.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:21,020
我们还可以使用CONTROL和JS控件对齐文本，明显的nj，我们将看到文本已经
We can also justify the text using control and JS control obvious NJ we'll see that the text has been

33
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,070
设置使其占据整个屏幕的宽度，现在控制您不对齐。
set so that it takes up the full width of the screen are controlling you now to unjustified.

34
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,480
但是你可以看到，如果我按Ctrl，NJ来对齐文本，我的意思是，段落占据了整个段落
But you can see if I press control NJ to justify the text the paragraph that I mean takes up the full

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,190
屏幕和节育的正确上下文的宽度，您可以证明它是正确的。
width of the right context for with the screen and for birth control and you can justify it.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,070
所以，如果你看一下控制J，你要记住的一些事情是合理的。
So something to bear in mind if you look at control J is justified.

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,130
在证明控件是合理的之前，您是未剪切的文本。
And before you justify control you is uncut text.

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,550
但是如果节育和J.
But if birth control and J.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,370
您看，您现在已经将控件切换为调整类型，它告诉您，您现在可以调整控制
You see that control you has now switched to justify kind it tells you here you can now justify controlling

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,730
你。
you.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,670
它又回到了以前的样子。
It goes back to the way that it was.

42
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,540
接下来我们有两个拼写选项，基本上是一个拼写检查器。
So up next we've got the two spell option which is basically a spell checker.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,920
现在，默认情况下，没有为Nonno设置拼写检查器。
Now by default a spell checker isn't set up for Nonno.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,720
所以如果我按Ctrl t，它会显示拼写检查失败，调用拼写错误，比如OK。
So if I press control t it will say spellchecking failed error invoking spell like OK.

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,100
这意味着实际上没有设置拼写检查器，但我们可以设置一个。
What that means is that there's a spell checker not actually set up but we can set one up.

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,370
因此，让我们通过按下0中的Ctrl来保存我们的文件来写入它。
So let's just save our file by pressing control in 0 to write it.

47
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,510
好的可以。
Yes that'll do.

48
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,520
然后按Ctrl X退出并使用Ctrl清除屏幕，l会看到许多键盘快捷键
And then press control X to exit and clear the screen with control and l see a lot of keyboard shortcuts

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,330
在这里进行。
going on here.

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:34,640
为了实际编辑文本，这是一种拼写检查器，用于NONNO，它位于
So to actually edit the text they that's sort of a spell checker that is used for Nonno that's in the

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,040
Nano配置文件，它实际上位于我们的ETSI文件夹中的一个名为Nano或C的文件中，因此
Nano configuration file which is actually located in our ETSI folder in a file called Nano or C so that's

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,920
用Nano打开并不是很讽刺，因为如果我们这样做，我们现在已经打开了我们的Nano Ossy
open not really ironically with nano because if we do that here we are we've now opened our nano Ossy

53
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,810
这就是劈开ATC劈开纳米奥西。
So it's slash ATC slash nano Ossy.

54
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:01,610
因此，如果我以图形方式向您显示我们要去哪里，我们将转到其他位置，从而在我们的基目录中
So if I show you that graphically where where we're going we are in our base directory by going to other

55
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,360
我想是地点。
location I think.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,250
这就是劈开文件夹。
So this is the slash folder.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,510
然后你去ATC。
Then you go ATC.

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:14,920
所以懒散的UTC，那么在这里的某个地方，会有一个叫做“无”的文件，我们没有人看到这一点。
So sloshy UTC then somewhere in here there'll be a file called none and none of us see this.

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,130
如果我们点击NORC，那基本上就是我们打开的。
If we click on NORC that's basically what we've opened.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,960
好的，但是我们要确保我们在这里打开它。
OK but let's make sure that we open it in in here.

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,060
好的。
OK.

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,500
实际上，在那一刻，这个文件实际上是在Ridable上，因为我们没有波斯人来编辑它。
Actually at the minute this file is in fact on ridable because we don't have the Persians to edit it.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,820
所以为了使它真正可编辑，我们需要做伪纳米懒散的UTC劈开纳米RC。
So to make that actually editable we need to do pseudo nano sloshy UTC slash nano RC.

64
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,940
好的，据称运行此命令的伪裸基本用户是管理员，但我们将继续讨论这一点
OK so this pseudo bare basic alleged to run this command is the administrator but we'll come onto that

65
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,370
课程后面会有更多的内容。
a bit more later in the course.

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,130
您可以输入通常用于登录的密码。
You enter your password that you normally use for logging in.

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,360
现在您可以编辑该文件了。
And now you can edit the file.

68
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,170
好的。
OK.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,080
现在这里有一行字，里面有咒语或咒语。
Now there's a line in here that has the word a spell or spell in it.

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,410
因此，让我们通过使用WHERE is Command表示WHERE is Aspell按Enter来找出这一点。
So let's find that by using the where is Command says where is aspell press enter.

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,180
它找到了它。
And it found it.

72
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,760
好的。
OK.

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,650
这里的这一行说，使用这个拼写检查器，而不是内部的拼写检查器。
So this line it says here use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.

74
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,960
此选项没有正确的默认值。
This option does not properly have a default value.

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,390
好的，要去除它，要真正实现它，我们只需要去除这个散列
OK so to get rid of that actually to make that actually happen we just need to get rid of this hash

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,960
符号并去掉前导空格。
symbol and get rid of the leading space.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,860
现在没有散列了，只是设置了Spella。
Now there's no there's no hash just set Spellar.

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,790
我拼写的Dash狂喜就是这样。
I spell dash ecstasy just like that.

79
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,740
然后我们写出并结案。
And we write out and close.

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:37,010
现在，如果我们回到Nano来获取日记文本，如果我们按Ctrl和t来实际停止咒语
And now if we go back into nano for our diary text if we press control and t to actually stop the spell

81
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,620
我们现在有一个拼写检查器在工作，所以这不是很酷，对吧，我们只是用Nonno来编辑Nonno。
checker we now have a spell checker working so it's not quite cool right we just use Nonno to edit Nonno.

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,350
太棒了。
It's awesome.

83
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,490
所以我们来了。
So here we are.

84
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,310
它正在接受拼写检查，它告诉我我的名字是错的。
It's going through a spell checker is telling me my name is wrong.

85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,220
那真是太迷人了，不是吗？
Well that's charming isn't it.

86
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,690
这就对了。
There you go.

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,700
这就是您可以实际开始设置拼写检查器的方式，您只需在
That's how you can actually go about setting up your spell checker and you can just enter things in

88
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,850
这里。
here.

89
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,690
所以如果我想改名为尤达，我当然会这么做。
So if I wanted to change my name to let's say Yoda which of course I do.

90
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,140
因为那太棒了。
Because that's totally awesome.

91
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,550
我刚输入5，你会看到我现在的名字是尤达，这是事实，因为它在视频上。
I just enter five and you see that my name is now Yoda and it's a fact because it's on a video.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,990
好的。
OK.

93
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,890
所以如果我现在走了，我还可以让一个人接近这些奥特曼人中的任何一个，你可以忽略替换Agta字典
So if I now go I can also close a human to any of these Otterman you can ignore replace Agta dictionary

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,440
并全部替换或忽略全部或任何可能的内容。
and replace all or ignore all or whatever it might be.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,280
但我们只需按X键退出，我们就可以回到正常状态了。
But let's just press X to exit and there we are we're back into normal stuff.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,300
所以一旦你编辑好了，你要做的就是等你的拼写检查器正常工作的时候再去做，这样你的拼写检查器就可以正常工作了
So once you've edited that all you've got to do it when you get to that so that your spell checker works

97
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,140
现在就可以开始了，还可以添加不同的字典和诸如此类的东西
you're good to go and it is possible to to also add different dictionaries and stuff like that as well

98
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,780
你也可以在网上找到这些信息。
and you can find that information online as well.

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,130
好的，我们就是这样做拼写检查和控制的，显然这会告诉你你的
OK so there we are that's how you do spellchecking and control and see is apparently tells you your

100
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,560
现在的位置如果我按下Ctrl键，他们会告诉我们我在95%中的第1条线上
current positions if I press control and say they will tell us I'm on line 1 out of ninety five percent

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,830
从第一列到第70列，共275个字符中的0个。
of the way through column one to 70 characters 0 out of 275.

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,330
如果我现在移到这里，按Ctrl键，然后说change，我现在在第7行，第10列。
So if I move over here now and I press control and say change I'm now on line 7 column 10.

103
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,520
所以对我们来说，这是很好的，你知道，如果你正在处理一个文件，你想把它交给某人
So for us this is this is good you know if you are working on a file and you want to give it to someone

104
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,010
然后你说，哦，嘿，你能在这个给定的位置更改这个文件吗，或者你在给人们指示
and you say Oh hey can you change this file at this given position or you're giving people instructions

105
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,180
关于如何使用您在第11栏中所说的Online 7的文件，请更改此文本。
on how to use a file you say online 7 in column 11 change this text.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,630
好的。
OK.

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,130
所以实际上只是为了展示一下，让我把它保存起来。
So in fact just to show you let me let me actually save that.

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,300
是。
Yes.

109
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:33,840
如果我去任何劈开、ETSI、劈开、NONO或C文件，我都能搜索到那个拼写在哪里。
If I go to any slash ETSI slash Nonno or C file and I can search for where is that a spell.

110
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:41,250
现在我可以告诉你，我被咒语迷住了，如果我按下Ctrl键，我可以看到我在第172行。
Now I can tell you I'm on a spell and if I press control and see I can see here that I'm on line 172.

111
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,390
因此，如果您想设置拼写检查器，请转到第172行，这是您需要编辑的行。
So if you want to set your spell checker go to line 172 and that's the line that you need to edit.

112
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,190
例如，这将是正确做这件事的一种方式。
For example that would be one way to do it right.

113
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,510
这样我就可以结束它，回到直接的文本中。
So I can close that get back into the direct text.

114
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:59,180
现在我们正在通过下一个选项是控制和得分以下，这让我们可以走到一条线上。
Now we're getting through the next option is control and under score and that allows us to go to a line.

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,810
好的。
OK.

116
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,880
所以如果我在范围上按下Ctrl键，然后先控制下划线。
So if I press control on the scope and first control the underscore.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,420
哦，对不起，我按错了按钮。
Oh sorry I'm pressing the wrong button here.

118
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,580
我们开始了，因为它只是放在我的电脑上一个有点奇怪的位置，控制着我的电脑。
There we go because it just goes in a bit of a weird position on my computer so controlling.

119
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,970
他说输入行号和列号。
And he says enter the line number and column number.

120
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,820
那么让我们转到10号线。
So let's go to line 10.

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,720
第二列，然后我们在第十行，看看我能不能让这个东西变得更大一点。
Column 2 and then we are in line 10 column to see if I can actually get this stuff to get a bit bigger.

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,380
好了，我把字体调大了一点。
There we go I've made the font a bit bigger.

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,420
所以对分数的控制做到了，因为我必须按下Ctrl和Shift，并下划线，我们开始了
So control on the score done it because I have to press control and shift and underscore there we go

124
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,720
反正是我的。
on mine anyway.

125
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,630
所以现在你要做一个行号和列号，或者比方说第9行，第12列。
So so now you're going to do a line number and column numbers or let's say Line 9 column 12.

126
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,200
我们走吧。
There we go.

127
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,160
我们在伊凡列上排队，不是用空格分隔的，用字母隔开的。
We are in line on Ivan columns aren't separated by spaces separated by letters.

128
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,650
好的。
OK.

129
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,120
这是他的专栏12，3，4，5，6，7，8，9，10，11，12。
So here are his column 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,490
好的。
OK.

131
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,420
这就是我们现在所处的位置，如果你想把它叫做12，不管是哪条线，我们都可能得到两个。
That's that's where we are this way we might get two if you want to call it 12 on whatever line.

132
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:05,060
所以如果我对你说让我们问问劈开ETSI劈开非战争是秋天，我在找使用的地方
So if I said to you let's ask Slash ETSI slash non-war was fall and I looked for using using the where

133
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,060
是命令。
is command.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,900
我确实控制了B，我搜索了一个咒语，然后我就到了这条线。
I do control the B and I search for a spell and I get to this line.

135
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,580
我就像是。
I'm like Huh.

136
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,600
这条线在哪里？
Where is this line.

137
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,450
控件并查看哪个是合成。
Control and see which is composition.

138
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,610
上面写着172号线。
It says Line 172.

139
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,870
好的，现在在你们的电脑上。
OK so now on your computer.

140
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,460
好的。
OK.

141
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:28,040
当您打开该文件时，您会看到类似haZ的内容，并显示第172行剩余控制，并在行中加下划线
When you open the file you get like ha Z and says Line 172 surplus control and underscore into line

142
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,890
172按Enter键。
172 press enter.

143
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,630
我已经走到了正确的路线上，所以你们可以看到，如果你们合作的话这可能会有多大的用处
And I've ended up at the correct line so you can see how useful that might be if you're collaborating

144
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,890
和某人一起做某事。
on something with someone.

145
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,590
所以让我们回到我们的日记胶带上吧。
So let's get back into our diary duct tape.

146
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,420
然后我们有撤消和重做。
We've then got undo and redo.

147
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,100
所以，举个例子，如果我把这里所有的东西都剪掉，然后我就会说，哦，我不想要那个。
So if I for example cut out all these things here and then I was like oh I don't want that.

148
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,330
让我解开。
Let me undo.

149
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,610
你可以看到，我只是撤销，它撤销了所有的漂白，我也可以按Olt，记住这可以
You can see I just undo and it undid all those bleatings I could also press Olt and remember this could

150
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,220
是转义还是命令取决于您的键盘布局和Modify键，不管它是用来做什么的
be escape or command depending on your keyboard layout and just the modify key whatever that is for

151
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,770
你。
you.

152
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:16,480
在我的键盘上是旧的，但是如果我按ALT，我们应该重做阿尔坦，你可以撤销重做奥尔森。
On my keyboard it's old but if I press alt and we should redo Altan you undo redo Olson.

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,170
奥尔顿，你。
Alton you.

154
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,340
对，对。
Yeah yeah.

155
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,410
我现在把它弄坏了，不过你明白我的意思。
I've broke it now but you get the point.

156
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,280
所以。
So.

157
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,160
所以这就是你撤销和重做东西的方式。
So that's how you can undo and redo stuff.

158
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,790
你能不能看看我能不能。
And instead of cutting Could you see if I could.

159
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,630
现在我可以取消裁剪而不是裁剪了。
Now I can uncut instead of cutting.

160
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,250
你实际上可以直接复制。
You can actually just directly copy.

161
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,260
所以在这里你要做所有的事。
So here you've got to do all.

162
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,400
6代表印刷机终极号码6。
And the number 6 for press ultimate number 6.

163
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:45,880
现在我可以按下你的控制键，我会开始粘贴，所以如果我在这里做，奥尔顿就6岁了，然后
Now I can press control in you and I'll start pasting so maybe if I if I do it here Alton's 6 and then

164
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,940
按下你身上的控制键。
press control on you.

165
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,690
现在我正在复制和粘贴，就像这样。
Now I'm copying and pasting just like that.

166
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,910
因此，据我所见，这将使您不必实际剪切和标记文本。
So that saves you from actually cutting and Mark text as far as I've seen.

167
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,060
我不经常用那个，但据我所知，它能做的就是让你突出显示一些东西
I don't use that one very often but as far as I can tell all that does is allow you to highlight stuff

168
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,840
所以，是的，它只是让你可以突出一些东西。
so yeah it just it just kind of allows you to highlight stuff.

169
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,630
所以我们走吧。
So there we go.

170
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:14,040
这基本上就是关于使用Nano命令需要知道的所有内容，所以你们是漂亮的人
That's basically everything you need to know about using the Nano command so you are you beautiful people

171
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,520
在最后几个视频中，您将非常熟悉使用基于Nano命令行的文本编辑器。
in the last couple of videos you become very familiar with using the Nano command line based text editor.

172
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,570
现在，使用基于命令行的文本编辑器(如Nano)的好处是，您可以获得所有
Now the benefit of using a command line based text editors such as nano is that you can get all of your

173
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,980
无需离开命令行即可完成工作，这基本上可以最大限度地提高您的工作效率。
work done without leaving the command line which basically maximizes your productivity.

174
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,510
它是一种命令行编辑器，与图形等效项相比，对资源的要求较低，因此您不需要
It's a command line editors have lower resource requirements than graphical equivalents so you don't

175
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,710
需要尽可能多的硬件使用量才能真正运行它们。
need as much hardware usage in order to actually run them.

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,920
另外，如果您正在远程管理服务器之类的东西，那么您在这里学到的技术将
And also if you are remote administering something like a server the techniques you've learnt here would

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,540
仍然可以使用，因为Nano基本上随Linux的每个版本一起提供，至少是最常见的版本。
still work because nano basically comes with every version of Linux at least the most common ones anyway.

178
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,630
您已经学习了如何使用Nano，我们已经研究了很多键盘快捷键选项，您可以看到
So you've learned how to use nano and we've looked at a lot of keyboard shortcut options and you saw

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,600
如何使用，以及几乎所有这些。
how to use and pretty much all of those.

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,530
所以你不需要记住它们，不用担心，现在你已经有了一点想法
So you don't have to memorize them don't worry about that now you've got a bit of an idea about how

181
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,070
它们起作用了。
they work.

182
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,020
老实说不是，我只是个文本编辑。
Honestly not I was just a text editor.

183
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,720
您只需在其中键入文本，您可以在其中编写任何您想要做的代码，您还可以对其进行编辑
You can just type text in there you can write code in there whatever you want to do and you can edit

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,610
文件在里面。
files in there.

185
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,410
但请记住，这些工具中的选项是使用键盘快捷键访问的。
But just bear in mind that the tools are the options in there are accessed using keyboard shortcuts.

186
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,880
如果你看到这顶小帽子，那就是控制键。
So if you see this little hat then that means the control key.

187
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,700
如果您看到减号，键盘上的旧转义键或命令键取决于您的
And if you see minus that either the old escape or command keys on your keyboard depending upon your

188
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,920
布局以试用它们，看看哪一个可以在您的键盘上工作。
layout to try them out see which one works on your keyboard.

189
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,190
在我的身上，你的身上可能会有所不同。
On mine it was all it might be different on yours.

190
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,010
您还可以看到，您可以通过编辑Nano的配置文件来编辑Nano的工作方式，该配置文件位于
And you also saw that you can edit how nano works by editing its configuration file which is located

191
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,180
在劈开ETSI劈开纳米或C.
at slash ETSI slash nano or C.

192
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,930
其中很多内容可能是供您参考的，因此您可以在这个视频中找到这些内容
So a lot of this stuff is going to be probably for reference for you so you've got it here in this video

193
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,720
在本课程中，如果您想查找任何内容，请稍后再参考。
in this course to refer back to later on if you want to look anything up.

194
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,810
但实际上，Nano很容易让你输入Nano，然后他们发现你想要编辑。
But really Nano is very simple to use you to type Nano and then they found that you want to edit.

195
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,440
你知道你可以像编辑任何其他文本文件一样去编辑它。
And you know you can just go and edit it like any other text file.

196
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,330
因此，您知道如何结束它，这是从命令行开始的，您应该会觉得
So there you are you know know how to end it follows from the command line and should be feeling quite

197
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,210
更像是电脑巫师。
a lot more like a computer wizard.

198
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,190
在这一点上。
At this point.

199
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,930
因此，随着所有这些超级棒的文件创建、移动、复制、粘贴和编辑，您将执行这些操作。
So with all this super awesome file creation moving copying and pasting and editing that you'll be doing.

200
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,990
您可能需要查找某些重要配置文件的位置，因此
It's possible that you might want to find where certain important configuration files are located so

201
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,980
你可以编辑它们，或者乌克兰要去哪里，但你不想去
that you can edit them or where that fall that Ukraine is run off to but you don't want to have to go

202
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,340
手动浏览每个文件夹以查找它们。
through each folder manually to look for them.

203
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,790
在下一个视频中，您将学习如何使用
So in the next video you're going to learn how to search for files anywhere on your system using the

204
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,770
定位命令定位命令是我的最爱之一，我迫不及待地想给你看。
locate command locate command is one of my favorites and I can't wait to show you.

205
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,210
所以对于所有这些好东西。
So for all that good stuff.

206
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,780
我将在下一个视频中见到你。
I'll see you in the next video.
