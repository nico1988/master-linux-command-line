00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,500
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,180
So in the last few videos you've been learning how to create and modify files and directories in all

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,390
kinds of different ways.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,970
And when you're working with files in your computer it's really easy to misplace one or two and wonder

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,910
where an important file that's new to you such a configuration file might be hiding.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,700
So in this video I'm going to show you how you can use the locate command to actually search for files

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,020
by name and find them no matter where they might be hiding on your computer or with the command line.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,870
Pretty cool right.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,170
So we're going to break this up into two parts in this video you're going to learn how to use the locate

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,580
command and some of his options.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,740
And you're also going to appreciate some of the limitations that the locate command can have.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,840
And then in the next video the one after this one you can to learn how to overcome those limitations

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,920
and also how to access administrator privileges on the system in order to update a database.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,620
So this is all going to be very cool stuff very very exciting.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,650
It's going to give you superpowers basically So let's just go ahead and get right into.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,610
OK so the locate command is actually really simple to use but it's very very useful.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,170
Now the first thing you need to know about the locate command is that it works by searching a database

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,360
file that's on your system.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,550
Now this database holds location information about every file that's on your system and the way that

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,770
the locate command works is that you will give it some pattern to look for and then locate will search

21
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,450
the database for every path that matches that pattern and give it back to you on standard output.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,610
Then this is actually really easy so let's just jump right in and get a feel for how this works.

23
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:39,270
OK so for example let's try and find every file in our system that ends in dot c o and F..

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,890
OK.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,730
Now Dot CNF is a file extension that is common on Linux to indicate that this file is a uneatable configuration

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,160
file.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,600
OK.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,290
Because file extensions don't really matter to Linux.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,820
Linux users and developers usually leave meaningful file extensions like dot com so that you can understand

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,250
what the form might be about just from reading the file extension log is another common example and

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,360
it's use for log files that store error messages from programs and server applications.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,590
So you know you can look at these log files later on in case anything breaks and see where the stuff

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,150
went wrong.

34
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,570
OK we're going to look at files end in dot com.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,210
OK now to search for all the dot com files on our system.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,900
One way to do is type the locate command and then give it the paten we want to search for.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,740
Now you should start remembering what we did about regular expressions and wildcards.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,500
So just think for a minute how would you make a pattern that matched any file that ended in dot com.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,850
Just think about it for a second.

40
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,540
And you might remember that perhaps you need to have the star wildcard and then dot com.

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,540
This says anything that matches this pattern here and that means it can start with anything and then

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,630
end in dot com.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,490
OK so this pattern will check for files that end in dot com.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,900
And that's actually all we need to do right.

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:03,270
So if we do that and press ENTER wo right you'll see like a whole bunch of different fall paths come

46
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,750
out.

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:11,010
But you'll see that every single one of these files ends in dot com.

48
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,510
Now it's worth noting that by default Linux is case sensitive.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,520
But you can make searches using the locate command case insensitive by giving the locate command the

50
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,630
option.

51
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:33,410
So for example if we just click the screen and we do locate and just say dot com but spell everything

52
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,780
in uppercase now you'll see that we actually get no results because Linux searched case sensitively.

53
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,750
It had to be exactly everything in uppercase.

54
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,450
OK.

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,730
But to make locate search in a case insensitive way we could give the locate command the option and

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,540
what this does is say hey don't worry about the case I'm just looking for these letters and when I do

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,470
that we get again files that end in dot com.

58
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,850
OK.

59
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,470
So that's something to bear in mind there.

60
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,010
And you can also limit the amount of results that you get.

61
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,080
So we have hundreds of results coming out this one look how many there are a lot of configuration files.

62
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:19,760
But if we click the screen we code say OK let's search in a case insensitive way but let's limit it.

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,730
Limit the outputs to just three results.

64
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,350
OK.

65
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,960
And you can see here I am using the long form.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,220
Limit options.

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,140
We got the two dashes then the word limit and then we give it's command line argument which is three.

68
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,020
So this limit option has an input of three.

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:44,120
So when I do that you can see that we are just limiting it to three results if I change that to 5 we'll

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,930
get five results for change to 10.

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,180
We will get 10 results and so on and so on.

72
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,990
So this is useful.

73
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,510
You know if you just want to get the first few results you only want to find a few results you can limit

74
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,160
it like that as well.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Now the key consideration to have when using the locate command is to understand that it uses a database.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,050
In fact you can actually find out information about the database using the capital S option.

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,770
So if I clear the screen and we use locate and give it the capital ask the uppercase s option I can

78
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,860
press enter and you'll see that we get some information about the database itself.

79
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:29,570
So it tells us the path to the database file as well as some size about the general saw some information

80
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,560
about the general size and complexity of the day base.

81
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,820
So I'm actually going to save this information using a redirects if I use locate acet I'm going to save

82
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,560
that into something on our desktop.

83
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,660
Let's call it database before texting.

84
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,330
So we've got Farkle database before that day on our desktop.

85
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,080
With all the information saved in it.

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,890
OK.

87
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,210
So you can see redirection is actually a very useful skill and you'll just use it all the time and you

88
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,750
should be proud.

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,270
Now you understand how to use it as if it's nothing.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,400
Right.

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,950
So this database just like any other day base is only useful if the information in it is up to date.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,610
OK.

93
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,770
And the database by default is updated just once a day.

94
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,470
So this means that anything that happens in the mean time is not logged in the database files could

95
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,190
have been created moved deleted and unless the database is updated then the locate command will start

96
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,620
to give incorrect results.

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,490
Now there are a few options that come with the locate command to help minimize this issue.

98
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,260
They can't make the database list files that haven't been added to it yet because that's impossible.

99
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,960
But they can prevent the locate command from showing files that have been deleted.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,390
In the meantime all things that no longer work.

101
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,380
For example there is the option that requires the locate command to check that the file is existing

102
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,900
before it reports it back.

103
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:57,440
So for example if we did locate with the option of everything that ends in dot com then this would check

104
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,860
the database for all files that ended in dot com but also do a check to make sure that those files actually

105
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,680
existed before reporting them rather than just taking it from the database directly.

106
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,430
It will take them from the database but also do a check to make sure that they are there.

107
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,010
So it gives you that extra bit of assurance there is a long form option for the options instead of typing

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,100
a dash 8.

109
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,280
You could type Double Dash existing.

110
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,700
OK.

111
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,850
And that does exactly the same thing.

112
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,320
So it's very very useful stuff.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,720
And sometimes there are shortcuts and links on your system called symbolic links that might be broken

114
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,600
if files get moved around to check whether these shortcuts and links are still valid before the locate

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,100
Command reports them back.

116
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:48,200
You can use the capital L or the follow option like this so locate follow everything ends in dot com

117
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,600
for this.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,960
So if there are any symbolic links are there any links to files it will check that they aren't just

119
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,180
dandling they actually arrive somewhere arrived at the right place for reporting it back.

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,000
That's another assurance and of course you can do both at the same time so existing and follow gives

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,840
you basically the maximum assurance you can get there.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,210
And again you can combine it with case insensitivity and limited to just show 5 and you can combine

123
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,520
all these options showing you here just how powerful the Linux command line can be to have multiple

124
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,610
different functions going at the same time.

125
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,440
Now these safety features are all well and good but what we really need to solve our problem is to have

126
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,280
a way to update the database whenever we like and there is it's called the update D-B command.

127
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,900
And for the purposes of time we're going to cut the video here and pick up learning how to update the

128
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,510
database in the next video.

129
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,360
So I'll see that.
