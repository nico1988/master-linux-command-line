00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,620
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,690
And in this video we're going to be wrapping up our discussion of how to navigate the Linux file system

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,190
using the command line.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,860
And in this video you're going to learn how to use tab auto completion to speed up your navigation of

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,710
the file system.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,470
And we're also going to have a recap of what everything that we've learned about navigating falses and

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,520
in the past few videos.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,460
And by the end of this video you can have all the knowledge that you need to navigate the false system

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,290
like a pro.

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,670
Just add practice and you're going to get plenty of that as we go through the course.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,230
So to get the final few pieces of information about tab auto completion.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,940
Let's go ahead and jump right into it.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,870
OK.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,680
So let's go ahead and learn about a really awesome feature known as tab completion.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,680
Now at the minute we're currently in our home directory as you can see by looking at the shell prompt

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,020
and also by using the P.W. DICOM and we see that we're in our home directory.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,450
Now we could actually jump all the way to the base directory of the system by just typing CD and then

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,160
a slash.

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,700
And if I do that you'll see that if we use the print working directory command we can see that we are

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,390
in the base direct of our system.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,730
I don't want to do this just to highlight that you don't have to go folder by folder when you using

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,840
the Siddiq and you can actually just jump all the way around your system.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,490
So for example if I wanted to jump all the way to my desktop I don't have to go CD then slash.

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,670
You know I don't have to go step by step all the way through.

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,130
I can just say CD give it the tilda and then say because that's my home folder and then say desktop.

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,960
OK.

27
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,440
Now we are we end up in the desktop so you can you see come into jump around.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,990
You don't have to go step by step.

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,410
OK.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,050
So clearly the scream Let's go ahead and now learn about tab completion.

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,460
So let's say that we wanted to get all the way to my home directory using an absolute path.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,530
OK.

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,970
We can do that simply by just typing it all right we can type CDs slash home slash Zyad And you know

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,250
if we're to go to documents we can type slash documents.

35
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,290
You know we would be there.

36
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,560
OK we would get all the way to the documents folder.

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,160
But typing it takes a bit of time.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,190
It's error prone and you know we're kind of lazy as programmers.

39
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,500
OK so we want speed and we want things to be without errors and we want things to work right the first

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,900
time.

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,470
So that's where tab completion comes in.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,900
Let's head back to our home or back to the very base directory and clear the screen.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,360
Peter Beattie we're in the base directory.

44
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,160
This is how you can use tab completion to get that room.

45
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,090
We want to get to the documents folder.

46
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,620
OK.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,690
So that's going to be like this.

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,310
OK that's where we're trying to get to.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,890
So let's see how we would get there which I've CD can slash now is that it's happening at home.

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,710
We could just type that page and press the tab and you'll see that the shell automatically completed

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,870
that piece of text for us.

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,910
Now that's pretty cool.

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,520
They're trying to type out Ziyad So we just type Zed and then we press tab and it's filled out my name.

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,510
Awesome right.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,960
Now let's say we want to go into documents.

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,440
OK let's let's try it.

57
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,000
Capital D and press tab.

58
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,040
Now why is it not working.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,370
Let's try again.

60
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,880
Cable is not working.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,950
Well the reason is this capital D could refer to lots of things in our home folder.

62
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,100
So let's take a look at it.

63
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,840
If we go to our home folder here.

64
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,040
Click the screen and take a look you can see that the capital D could refer to the desktop it could

65
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,400
refer to the downloads or it could refer to the documents and the documents that we want.

66
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,080
OK.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,860
So if a file if you.

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Now if I say OK I want to go to the capital D here and press tap twice with each passing ones it won't

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,520
work.

70
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,420
Suppress it twice really quickly.

71
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,720
Just like that.

72
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,960
It will actually.

73
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,650
It's a lot.

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,770
It will actually clear the screen.

75
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,960
It will press it twice it will actually tell us which ones it matches.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,760
OK.

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
So we want to go into documents if I type doc.

78
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,090
OK.

79
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,680
Because what audio and double tap that's still no good because it could go for documents or downloads

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,320
of a type doc and then press tab.

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,770
Now it's going to go to documents.

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,240
OK.

83
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,290
And there we all were in the Documents folder.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
So that's awesome.

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,370
And it cut down our level of typing and error proneness massively So if we go all the way back to the

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,990
root directory.

87
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,610
Now we can just type CD slash page tab Zad tab DOHC tab.

88
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,620
There we are in the documents folder.

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,940
It's really really cool.

90
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,510
This will work for filenames just like it will for folders and it's amazing and I use it all the time.

91
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,960
OK.

92
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,920
Nas one final awesome trick.

93
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,830
Let's not forget to the desktop the graphical way.

94
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,390
OK.

95
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,270
So we're going to open.

96
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,870
We're going to go into the gooey.

97
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,310
We're going to get to the desk top and it's actually open a terminal.

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,610
So the shell is operating from in this directory.

99
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,020
You can right click and you'll notice that you'll see an option here that says Open in terminal.

100
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,680
OK.

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,850
So if we click that you can see that we've got a terminal that's automatically opened in the desktop.

102
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,940
So say for example you're doing stuff in your navigating files in your data in your or your documents

103
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,310
folder.

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,620
OK we've got some files in here let's say.

105
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,820
Then you could actually just right click and click Open in terminal and you directly now operating in

106
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,500
your terminal.

107
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,520
From within that documents folder.

108
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,850
So you know if you're doing stuff graphically and then you want to switch the terminal and then switch

109
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:24,240
back and this is a nice shortcut to be able to use OK so you've learned a whole bunch of stuff in the

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,240
last three videos or so about navigating the Linux file system so I just wanted to take a bit of time

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,610
to have a quick recap of what we have learned to make sure that it's all sunk in.

112
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:42,030
So you know that you use the PWT command to print the current working directory that the shell is operating

113
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:49,530
in and it will print an absolute path to where on the file system your shell is currently operating.

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,170
You can use the ls command to see what's around you when you are in that directory it is a list so the

115
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:01,080
contents of the directory folders are in blue and files are in white but you can make that easier to

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,350
see using the the capital f option.

117
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,210
And we went through several other options that the ls command can have to make you know viewing things

118
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,460
and viewing files in the in the command line.

119
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,390
A lot easier.

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,420
You saw that the cd command can be used to change directory or move to a new location on the file system.

121
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,160
And you saw the absolute paths are paths that start at the very base directory of the file system so

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,800
the slash and relative paths are the paths that start from the directory that your shell is currently

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,640
in.

124
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,220
So relative paths are usually easier to type but absolute paths are very clear as to where they end

125
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,510
up.

126
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,130
OK.

127
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,700
Now every directory has the dot and dot dot.

128
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:50,220
Hidden folders that you can see using the ls command with the option and the dot the one dot is four

129
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,940
means the current folder and the two dots Riffe refer to the parent folder of where you currently are.

130
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,570
So if you did CD and then did dot dot that would move you up a folder OK because it's saying Go up go

131
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,130
to the parent folder where I currently am and if you did see the data then that would just basically

132
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,170
keep you where you wouldn't make any difference.

133
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,700
OK.

134
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,660
Now tab auto completion we saw in this video and we saw that tabbouleh commission is a really useful

135
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,700
technique to speed up typing and avoiding errors.

136
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,900
And if you press tab and nothing happens just hit tab twice really quickly and it will show you several

137
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,100
options that are conflicting and you can just then type out a bit more to make sure that it selects

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
the one you want.

139
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,560
So like we saw when we print when we type the capital D it wasn't working but if it's press tab twice

140
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,880
we could see that it was clashing with documents downloads and desktop.

141
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,580
And then we could modify their own to make sure tabel to completion worked.

142
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,040
But you use tab order completion all the time it saves you so much time and so much hassle.

143
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,830
It's a great great feature that the show has and it can also be used anywhere not just when navigating.

144
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:59,790
So if you're if you are you know trying to enter an argument to a command and it's a file path you can

145
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,580
use tab auto completion.

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,450
There is why it's not just when using CD or ls or whatever it might be you can use it for pretty much

147
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,330
any command.

148
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,900
And if you want to open up a terminal where you currently are when you're navigating graphically using

149
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,690
the graphical user interface just right click and click Open in terminal and a terminal will open up

150
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,460
with the current directory being exactly where you were when you opened that terminal.

151
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,200
So that's a really useful features why if you just need to make some quick edits on the terminal and

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,630
then shut it again and get back to doing what you are graphically.

153
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,880
It's a great great feature.

154
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,900
So make sure you keep hold of that.

155
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,280
So we've got a whole bunch of stuff in the last few videos and now you should start feeling comfortable

156
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,660
with how to navigate you just use Peter Beattie to see where you are.

157
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:47,340
LS to look around and see to move and in the next video we're going to start discussing file extensions

158
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,110
in Linux because they don't work like they might do on other operating systems and there's quite a few

159
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,920
core freedoms that fall extensions that you have when working in Linux.

160
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,160
So for that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
