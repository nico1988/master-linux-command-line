00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello you beautiful people know when you're using files or when you're using data from standard output

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,620
it's very likely that you won't want all of the data but rather you just want a specific piece of it

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,780
and you'll want to cut out all the rest.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,240
Now the way that we do that in Linux is using a command called the grep command.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,830
And if you've ever searched about Linux on your own maybe just been you know using a search engine having

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,920
a look around you'll know that I've already come across the group come on just how useful it is.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
So in the next few videos we're going to be showing you how you can use the grep command to search through

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
files and standard output so that you can filter out just the data that is important to you.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,580
And by the end of the next few videos you're going have a very powerful new tool that will allow you

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,780
to do what you want much faster help you find things in data much faster.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,920
And we help you cut out a lot of the fluff that you don't want so that you can get the results that

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,400
you want.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
So let's just go ahead and get right into it.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,260
OK.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,360
So as a quick heads up the first thing I want to talk about is what the grep command actually does.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,610
OK before we start discussing how it works.

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:05,040
So the grip command will search whatever input you give it for lines that contain a particular piece

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,130
of text that you tell it to search for.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,720
OK.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,920
So for example I have a file here called haloed optics on our desktop.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,770
And if I head over to the desktop and use the cat command to take a look at what's inside it.

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,520
Surprise surprise it says hello there beautiful people with each word on its own line.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,150
Now let's use the grep command to find all the lines in there that contain the letter e.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,720
OK now the way that we do that is we would type grep.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,100
Then what we're searching for.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,110
So the letter A.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,240
And then what we're looking in.

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,690
So we'd say hello dot text.

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,160
Ok so here what we're saying is hey grep find every line in Hello dot text that contains the letter

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,540
E and now by default the grep command is case sensitive.

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,280
So uppercase and lowercase do matter.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,850
OK so if I press Enter you'll see here that we're seeing the lines that contain the letter E and even

33
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,300
the letters themselves have also been highlighted.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,500
So that's pretty cool.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:15,240
Now interestingly in 1939 there was a person called Ernest Vinson right who wrote a novel called Gadsby

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
that was about 50000 words long.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,340
Now the special thing about Gadsby was that even though it was 50000 words long.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,950
Not once was the letter he used it was not incredible especially if you consider that the letter E is

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,950
apparently the most commonly used letter in the English alphabet.

40
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,680
So that's really quite an achievement to write a 50000 word book like a story without using the letter

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,510
A.

42
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,600
And I just so happen I don't know how this happened to have a copy of Gadsby here in this randomly created

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,240
folder on our desktop called Gadsby right here so we want Gadsby manuscript Dotti XTi.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,780
Now the book is so old now that it's freely available in the public domain and you can get access to

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,070
it to using the link that I'll put in the resources.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,720
Now Anyway the reason for this is that we can use the come on to count the number of lines a certain

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,010
piece of text appears.

48
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,700
OK.

49
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,330
So for example we see that when we search for the letter E in Hello 0.60 we get four results right.

50
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,850
So we get hello there beautiful people.

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,370
OK.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,600
So we can actually confirm this we can take a look by giving the rep come on the C option and this will

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,450
tell you how many lines it'll just give you the number of lines that it finds and it tells us that we

54
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,350
get four.

55
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,990
OK.

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,010
So it says hey I found four lines that had the letter E in them in Hello T S T.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,490
Now we have the text file called Gadsby manuscript Dottie XTi.

58
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,140
OK.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,760
And if we open it you can see that there is so much stuff in here.

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,140
OK.

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,800
Is the fact the book is about 43 chapters long with over 50000 words and actually I can tell you how

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,940
many lines is in there by going into the Gadsby folder and using the word count with the command on

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,090
the Gatsby manuscript and tells us that it tells us that there's one thousand nine hundred and fourteen

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,950
lines which is quite a lot of lines.

65
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:21,840
OK so let's try and search for the word Gadsby in the book Gadsby because if I do grep Gadsby inside

66
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,640
Gadsby manuscript Dottie XTi you'll notice that nothing shows up.

67
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,770
And the reason that nothing shows up is because Gadsby starts with a capital G and we spelt it with

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,490
a lowercase g here.

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,560
Now we can search in a case insensitive manner.

70
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,520
So the uppercase and lowercase don't matter at all by giving the group command the option.

71
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,430
OK so when we do that we'll see that it shown us it shown us a different amount of results here and

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,090
there's quite a few times that Gadsby has appeared in the book.

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,480
Gadsby has as clear the screen.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,310
You can also search for the letter A in the Goldsby book just by putting the letter A here and we'll

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,350
see that we get a whole bunch of lines where the letter A is used.

76
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,010
OK.

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:13,190
And we can count that as well if we want by pressing the C option and we see this 951 lines that contain

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,030
the letter.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,240
So that's quite a lot.

80
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,490
So now let's try and see how many times the book uses the letter.

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,590
OK so that we do that is we don't care whether it's uppercase or lowercase we don't want any e's.

82
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,560
So we're going to keep it case insensitive.

83
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,560
And would it count how many lines there are.

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,220
And we're going to put there the latter.

85
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,720
And if we go ahead now and press ENTER we can see that the answer is zero.

86
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,020
So the Gatsby manuscript doesn't use the letter E and this has been approved Linux approved that it

87
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,950
doesn't use the letter.

88
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,620
So download the manuscript in the resources section and try it out for yourself.

89
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,130
Now you can actually also search for full sentences as long as you surround them in quotes.

90
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,910
So one phrase that is quite a bit in the book is the is the line our boys so we could search in there

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,450
for boys and we're going to put that in quotes to make sure it goes in as one argument.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,230
And when we press ENTER you can see those nine lines that contain it but let's just take a look as well

93
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,970
to see them so you can see there's quite a few results for the text.

94
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,210
Ah boys.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,800
Now you can also search for lines that don't match a specific piece of text.

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,870
OK.

97
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,160
So you can see how many lines there are in the whole Gatsby document using the word count commands if

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:40,810
I do a word count dash l Gad's B manuscript in 1914 lines right now because there's no letter E in Gadsby.

99
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,200
There should be 1914 lines without the letter H.

100
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,420
Right now we can check that using the V option.

101
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,190
Now the v option basically does the opposite or invert the search.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,210
OK so if we do grep with egrep with the v option for.

103
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,980
E A K in Gadsby manuscript Dotti x t.

104
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,140
What we're doing is we are trying.

105
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,410
This is going to find all the lines that don't have the letter E in them.

106
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,560
Like I said without the V you will find all the lines that do have e in them and with the v option you'll

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,250
find all the lines that don't have the letter V in them so let's do that.

108
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,760
So we saw a whole bunch of stuff has come out.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,710
But how many of them how many of them have actually come out.

110
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,580
Well we can count them using the C option and I'm going to court I'm going to cut it right now.

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,840
Will it be 1914 lines will Gadsby actually contain no letter.

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,700
Oh what a save on time.

113
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,040
Come back in the next video to find out.
