1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,650
你好，漂亮的人们欢迎收看这个视频，在这里你们将学习如何复制和粘贴
Hello you beautiful people are welcome to this video where you're going to learn how to copy and paste

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,150
使用命令行创建文件和文件夹。
files and folders using the command line.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,140
现在，这应该是一个很好的、快速的讲课，只有一个命令。
Now this should be a nice and quick lecture with just one command.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,560
在Linux中处理所有文件和文件夹复制的C.P.命令。
The C.P. command which handles all the copying of files and folders in Linux.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,930
在视频结束时，您将了解如何使用命令行和
By the end of the video you'll know how to copy and paste files and folders using the command line and

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,980
您还将了解如何将C-p命令与通配符配合使用，以使复制和粘贴更加出色。
you also see how to use the C-p command with wildcards to make copying and pasting even more awesome.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,200
所以，让我们继续直截了当地谈吧。
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,040
好的。
OK.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,860
所以我们来了。
So here we are.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,010
正如您在shell提示符中看到的那样，我当前在桌面上，并且在桌面上有一个文件
And as you can see by the shell prompt I'm currently on the desktop and on the desktop I have a file

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,150
这里叫做文件1.60，如果我打开它，它会说你好，你们这些漂亮的人。
here called File 1.60 and if I opened it says hello there you beautiful people.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,530
我想知道这是怎么回事。
I wonder how that got there.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:52,250
假设我们想要将该文件复制到另一个名为file to DR XTi的文件中。
So let's say we wanted to copy that file to another file called file to Dr XTi.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,940
好的，因为我非常非常富有想象力。
OK because I'm very very imaginative.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,490
因此，要复制它，我们使用cp命令，C-p是copy的缩写。
So to copy it we use the c p command and the C-p being short for copy.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,990
现在我们只需要告诉COPY命令。
Now we just need to tell the copy command.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,520
我们要复制的内容以及要复制到的位置。
What we want to copy and where we want to copy it to.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,640
那么我们要复制什么呢。
So what do we want to copy.

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,410
嗯，我们想要复制文件1.60。
Well we want have to copy file 1.60.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,110
请记住，我已经在桌面上洗澡了，所以如果我在家里，我可以只写1.60美元
And remember I'm on the desktop already in the shower so I can just write for 1.60 if I was in the home

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,500
文件夹，我会说将桌面sosh复制到1.60，只是为了让你知道。
folder I would say copy desktop sosh for 1.60 just just so that you're aware.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,710
好的。
OK.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,300
那么让我们再来一次桌面。
So let's go to the desktop again.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,780
所以我们需要告诉它我们想复制什么，我们想要复制到什么地方。
So we need to tell it what we want to copy and we want to copy it to.

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,730
所以我们想要一份1.60的拷贝，我们想拷贝到一个或者叫做“法尔图战术”的文件中。
So we want a copy for 1.60 and we want to copy to one or the file called Faltu tactics.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,670
这就是我们要输入的全部内容，希望将一个文件复制到另一个名为File2.6的文件中，当我这样做时
So that's all we've got to type want to copy far one into another file called File 2.6 and when I do

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,760
我们会在这里看到一个叫做法尔图的文件。
that we'll see we get a file here called Faltu.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,210
当我张开嘴的时候，我也会向你们打招呼，你们这些漂亮的人。
And when I open up that also says hello there you beautiful people.

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,860
好的。
OK.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,310
这就是如何将一个文件复制到另一个文件，这非常简单。
So that's how you copy a file to another file which is pretty simple.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,530
那么，如何将文件复制到目录的另一个文件夹。
So how would you copy a file to another folder to the directory.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,290
嗯，那也很简单。
Well that's pretty simple too.

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,030
正如我所说的复制命令，您所要做的就是告诉它您想要复制什么以及要复制到哪里
As I say the copy command all you've got to do is tell it what you want to copy and where you want to

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,060
将其复制到。
copy it to.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,760
好的。
OK.

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,870
假设我要将Fall One复制到名为Destination的文件夹中。
So let's say I want to copy fall one into this folder called Destination.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,270
好的。
OK.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,820
所以我要做的就是复制文件一。
So I'll have to do is I copy file one.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,480
到目前为止是1.60，复制到目的地。
So far 1.60 and copy to destination.

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,360
也可以说我同时也想复制法尔图。
And also let's say I also wanted to copy Faltu at the same time.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,240
好的，这是一份拷贝，并将Faltu文件放到目标文件夹中。
OK so it's copy for one and file Faltu into the destination folder.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,140
好的，您可以在这里看到，您放在命令行参数中的最后一件事是目的地
OK so you can see here that the last thing that you put as a command line argument is the destination

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,710
所有其他的东西都是你想要复制的，所以我可以有很多
and everything else that comes with for that is what you want to copy so I could have many many many

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,430
不同的命令。
different commands.

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,540
我想在这里复制很多不同的文件，但最后一个是我想要复制它们的位置
And many many different files that I want to copy here but the last one is where I want to copy them

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,130
都到了。
all to.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,800
对，是这样。
Correct.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,800
现在，让我们继续按Enter，当我查看Destination内部时，我们可以看到
So with that let's go ahead press enter and when I look inside destination we can see that we've got

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,360
四号，一号文件，二号文件。
four one on file two.

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,990
他们都被复制进去了。
They have both been copied into that.

51
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,740
如您所见，使用该命令，整个复制和粘贴业务实际上相当简单
So as you can see this whole copying and pasting business is actually rather simple with the command

52
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,140
排队。
line.

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,190
当然，您也可以使用通配符。
And of course you can also do it with wild cards.

54
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,350
所以我现在在桌面上。
So I'm on the desktop at the minute.

55
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,890
假设我想删除所有以Word file开头的内容。
Let's say I want to remove everything that starts with the Word file.

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,750
因此，如果我这样做，两个文本文件都应该消失，因为它们都以单词file开头。
So if I do that both the text files should disappear because they both begin with the Word file.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,070
所以如果我这么做了，他们是不是都消失了。
So if I do that are they both disappear.

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,620
现在我可以将目标文件夹中的所有内容复制并粘贴到桌面，但您是说
Now I can copy and paste all the stuff from in the destination folder to the desktop but you're saying

59
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,820
复制目的地。
copy destination.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,260
劈开应有尽有。
Slash everything.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,040
好的。
OK.

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,330
放到这个折叠处。
To this fold.

63
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,080
以及如何选择此文件夹。
And how do I select this folder.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,540
如果你还记得，在每个位置总是有一个隐藏的文件夹，这指的是
Well if you remember back the there's always a hidden folder in each location and that refers to the

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,370
文件夹是，如果我只是这样做，那是句号，所以如果我只做那个点。
folder is if I just do and that is the full stops so if I just do that dot dot.

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,760
这意味着将目标文件夹中的所有内容复制到此文件夹中，该文件夹是
What that means is copy everything from within the destination folder into this folder which is the

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,050
桌面，这就是我们目前所在的游戏。
desktop which is where we currently are the game.

68
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,200
所以如果我这样做，如果我按Enter键。
So if I do that if I press enter.

69
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,560
您将看到文件ONE FILE已被复制并粘贴到此位置，该位置由
You'll see the file one file to have been copied and pasted to this location which is represented by

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,470
句号在这里。
the full stop here.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,740
如果你不记得我是不是只用A选项来做l，你可以在这里看到，我们有这两个
And if you don't remember if I just do ls with the A option you can see here that we've got these two

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,900
隐藏文件夹和一个文件夹指的是此文件夹，折叠的文件夹指的是双倍文件夹
hidden folders and the one with the one refers to this folder and the one with the doubled up refers

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,720
添加到它上面的文件夹，这是我们的主文件夹。
to the folder above it which is our home folder.

74
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:31,770
好的，例如，我可以将目标文件夹中的所有内容复制到其中的父文件夹
OK so I could for example copy everything from the destination folder to the parent folder of where

75
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,770
我们目前是哪个是主文件夹。
we currently are which is the home folders.

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:41,010
如果我这样做，现在查看我们的主文件夹，我们可以看到在其中创建了一个文件
If I do that and I now look at our home folder we can see the file one file to have been created in

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,680
那里。
there.

78
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,070
所以请看，通配符对任何命令都非常有效。
So look wildcards work absolutely great with any command.

79
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,750
甚至复制命令也是如此。
Even the copy command as well.

80
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,110
那么让我们清理一下屏幕。
So let's clear the screen.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,580
我们已经了解了如何将一个文件复制并粘贴到另一个文件中。
We have seen how to copy and paste a file into another file.

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,760
我们已经了解了如何将文件复制和粘贴到文件夹中，以及如何从文件夹复制粘贴文件
We've seen how to copy and paste a file into a folder and we've seen how to copy paste files from folders

83
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,380
放到其他文件夹中。
into other folders.

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,780
我们唯一需要知道的就是如何复制和粘贴整个文件夹。
The only thing we need to know is how to copy and paste entire folders.

85
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,900
好的，我们在这里。
OK so we have here.

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,790
这个复制桌面上的文件夹，里面有三个文件。
This copy the folder on the desktop and that's got three files in it.

87
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,280
里面有法利赫·法比和法西。
It's got Faleh Fabi and falsie.

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,960
好的。
OK.

89
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,450
我们希望将整个文件夹复制到目标文件夹中，这样我们不仅需要
And we want to copy this entire folder into the destination folder so we don't just want the files we

90
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,970
文件夹也要，这样我们就不只想要巧克力了。
want the folder as well so we don't just want the chocolate.

91
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,300
我们还想要包装纸。
We also want the wrapper.

92
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,020
好的。
OK.

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,350
我们可以这样做的方法是，给C-p命令一个选项，这个选项也代表递归。
So the way that we can do this is by giving the C-p command the option which also stands for recursive.

94
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,450
现在，如果您还记得我们在上几个视频中使用R.M.删除文件和文件夹时的情景
Now if you remember from when we were deleting files and folders in the last few videos with the r.m

95
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,970
选项递归删除意味着删除该文件夹以及其中所有内容。
option recursive deleting meant delete that folder and everything inside it.

96
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,950
这与复制命令非常相似。
And it's very similar for the copy command.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,290
我们要说的是复制文件夹和其中的所有内容。
What we're saying is copy the folder and everything inside of it.

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,890
好的。
OK.

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,760
因此，要将文件夹的副本实际复制到我们刚才键入的目标文件夹中，我们假设可以
So to actually copy the copy of the folder into the destination folder we just typed out we say could

100
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,260
我们说使用选项进行复制，然后将我复制到目标文件夹，如果我这样做了，我们就会查看
we say copy with the option then copy me into the destination folder and if I do that and then we look

101
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,350
在目标内部，我们将看到Copy Me文件夹已复制并粘贴，并且所有
inside the destination we will see that the copy me folder has been copied and pasted and all of the

102
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,570
不同的文件也在里面。
different files are inside there as well.

103
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,880
一切安然无恙。
All safe and sound.

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,730
所以他们拿到了。
So they have it.

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,040
现在，您可以使用命令行复制和粘贴文件和文件夹。
You can now copy and paste files and folders using the command line.

106
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
这很容易，对吧。
It's quite easy right.

107
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,230
作为非常快速的回顾，您可以看到C-p命令处理文件的复制和粘贴
So as a very quick review you saw that the C-p command is what deals with copying and pasting of files

108
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,340
和Linux中的文件夹，它的工作方式是你有你输入的C.P.。
and folders in Linux and the way that it works is you have the C.P. you type c.p.

109
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,110
然后你想复制什么，你可以想要多少就有多少。
Then what you want to copy and you can have as many of those as you like.

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,330
最后，您给它的最后一个命令行参数就是您的目的地。
And then in the end the last command line argument that you give it is your destination.

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,760
好的。
OK.

112
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,320
所以你可以有很多你想复制的东西，但是你给它的最后一件事就是单一的目的地
So you can have many things you want to copy but the final thing that you give it is the single destination

113
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,450
你想把这些东西都放到哪里去。
where you want all of those things to go.

114
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,540
现在，如果您想复制整个文件夹，不仅要复制它们的内容，还要复制实际的包装器
Now if you want to copy entire folders so not just their contents but the actual wrapper the actual

115
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,970
文件夹本身。
folder itself.

116
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,300
然后，您需要为copy命令提供允许其递归复制整个文件夹的选项。
Then you need to give the copy command the option to allow it to copy entire folders recursively.

117
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,990
现在有了复制和粘贴，接下来我们要做的是，我们将讨论
And now with copying and pasting and way up next what we're going to be doing is we're going to be discussing

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
在Linux中移动和重命名文件和目录。
moving and renaming files and directories in Linux.

119
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,910
真正有趣的是，您实际上可以使用一个命令来完成这两件事。
And what's really interesting is that you can actually use just one command to do both those things.
