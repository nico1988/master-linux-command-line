1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,590
Lovin you beautiful people are welcome to part two.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,780
Navigating the Linux file system.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,660
So in this video we're going to build upon what we learned in the last video about using the PWT and

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,910
the LS commands.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,910
But in this video you're going to learn how to use the cd command to actually move around the file system.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,440
You're going to learn the difference between absolute and relative paths.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,140
You can learn some awesome keyboard shortcuts that will make navigating the file system so quick and

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,950
so easy and you basically going to see how you can put together the PWT the Ls and the CD commands to

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,510
elegantly navigate the file system.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,390
By the end of this video you're going to know everything you need to know about navigating the Linux

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,220
file system using the command line and you watch with a bit of practice you'll soon agree with me that

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,250
doing it this way is a lot faster and a lot more effective than using your pointy clicky graphical methods

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,360
that you've been using.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,540
Probably all of your life so far.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,220
So let's go ahead and jump right into this next part of your superhero training.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,060
OK.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,530
So in the last video we saw that we could use the P W D command to see where we were on the file system

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,510
and we saw that we could use the ls command with a variety of different options to basically look around

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,760
and list what was in the directory the way in.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,130
But using just these two commands we're kind of stuck in the one place right how can we actually move

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,070
from our home directory.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,790
Well the missing piece is the C D command and the cd command stands for change directory.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,930
So let's say that we used our last kind and we saw that the downloads folder by noting that it's in

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,280
blue and it's a folder and we wanted to go into the downloads folder.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,260
How would we do that.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,960
What we could do it in a few ways.

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,010
Firstly we can give the cd command the absolute path for where we want to go with a go starting at the

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,810
base directory we'd go slash then home then Ziyad then downloads OK and we could type that in like that

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,020
and that would totally work or if we didn't want to have to write the entire path to our home directory

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,830
we could just replace all that with the Tilda.

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:07,030
We say OK go change to our home directory and then download that's where you'd use the tilde at a shortcut

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:15,330
or what we could use is something known as a relative path number relative path is a path relative to

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,400
where you currently are.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,670
OK so because we're currently in the home folder how do we get to the downloads folder.

35
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,420
Well let's think about it if we open up the graphical graphical menu.

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,990
Here we are we're in the home folder from here.

37
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,350
What do we do to get to the downloads folder.

38
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,110
We literally all we have to do is just click downloads right so that you can say that that's a relative

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,870
path which is going from here to the download that's all we've got to do.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,370
So to change to the downloads folder all we've got to do is type downloads.

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,870
So if we do that if we just type CD and then downloads just like that and press ENTER you can see that

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,060
we have changed directory and a shell prompt has changed as well before it was just the tilda telling

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,430
us that we were in our home directory.

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,590
Now it's saying we're in our home directory and the downloads folder inside.

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,270
OK.

46
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,580
So this is this text in blue here shows us the path to where we currently on if we use the PWT command

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,950
now we can see that we get slash home slashy or slash downloads and we can also look around by pressing

48
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,050
the ls command and we can see that there's actually nothing inside that folder.

49
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,410
OK so neither We're not Downloads folder.

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,090
Here's a challenge for you.

51
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:37,080
Go ahead and post the video and see if you can use the CD command to change back to our home directory.

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,700
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot and then come back to see how you did.

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,810
Did you manage it.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,860
If so really really well done.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,600
You learn super quickly now you could have done it using an absolute path like this you could type CD

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,350
then slash home slash your username or whatever would be in my case it Ziyad slash.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,340
And that's it.

58
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,620
OK that would work.

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,510
Or you could have used a Tilda to make it nice and easy just use CD and then Attilla.

60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,040
Now I kind of cheated a little bit because there's another way that you could have done it.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,710
And this is the way you probably do it from now on.

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,510
But I haven't shown you this before.

63
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,780
Now by default if you don't give me any input the CD command will take you to your home folder.

64
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,570
So if we just type CD like from scratch type CD and press ENTER you can see by just looking at the shell

65
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,190
prompt that we've ended up back in our home directory we can use Peter Beattie to confirm that.

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,520
I mean it tells us that we are back in our home directory and that will work no matter where I was previously

67
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,220
on the file system I could have been anywhere on the file system all of the do is type CD or press Enter

68
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,230
then I will end up back in the home directory.

69
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,140
Pretty cool right.

70
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,030
Okay great.

71
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,340
So now we're back in the home folder I want to show you a very useful option for the ls command.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,900
It's kind of like wearing X-ray glasses.

73
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,860
And it's the A option that the option is short for all.

74
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,760
And it allows you to see all of the files in a directory even the hidden files.

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,950
So if I type ls and give it the option OK.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,620
If I press Enter you'll notice that we see a whole lot of stuff in here.

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,250
Print it out.

78
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,240
OK if I clear the screen on top you just the last option and then show you the ls with the A option

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,740
you'll see we get a lot more stuff with the A option.

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,830
Now a lot of these files you'll notice have fall names beginning with dots and that means that there

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,760
hidden files or even hidden directories.

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,300
OK.

83
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,690
Now if we look in the graphical editor we may not be able to actually see them by default but if we

84
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,780
click up here like we do in the last few videos and show hidden files we can now see them as well so

85
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,630
you look you can see that we're getting exactly the same output so that's how you show hidden files

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,120
using the using the the the ls command.

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,580
OK.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,450
And you may also notice in here that we've got our bash alias's file that we made a few videos ago.

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,900
Now the reason I mention this is because these two very important hidden folders inside each folder.

90
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,850
They are the dot and the double dot folders.

91
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,100
OK.

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,050
Now these are shortcuts to allow you to move around easier or refer to stuff on your file system a whole

93
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,600
lot easier.

94
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,960
The doc folder simply refers to the current directory.

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,430
OK.

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,430
So for example if I go to the Desktop folder OK then we can print.

97
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,500
My apologies if I can do print working directory and we can see that we have that we are in the desktop

98
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,050
and if our list its contents this shouldn't really be anything on my desktop.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,270
But there always is this data and double dot folders which are only visible using the ls with the option

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,260
of just the normal address.

101
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,260
It doesn't show up for duellists dash 8.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,930
They show up.

103
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,590
OK.

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,250
Now in here we've got the dot and the double dot folders.

105
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:57,190
If I try to do cd to the doc folder Bash is basically going to stay where is the shell is going to stay

106
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,480
exactly where is if I do that.

107
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,080
You can see that we're still in the desktop looking at the shell prompt because the DOT folder refers

108
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,690
to the current folder that we're in.

109
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,210
OK.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,600
It's just a way of saying this folder.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,480
OK.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,880
Now what if I went to the doubleback.

113
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,230
What if I do cd doubled up OK.

114
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,930
You noticed that we did actually change and were in fact back in our home folder the doubled up folder

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,610
means the parent folder or the folder above where we currently are.

116
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,170
OK.

117
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,260
So if I go back to the desktop you can see that we've got the doubled up for if I press CD double that

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
we've gone back up a folder.

119
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,620
Which brings us into the home directory in case we're back in a home directory let's clear the screen.

120
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,240
What if I kept going.

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,830
OK if I go see the dot dot I'm now in the actual home folder which is not my home folder but it's the

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,170
folder above my home folder.

123
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,400
OK let's keep going.

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
See the dot dot.

125
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,630
And now we're actually just in the slash for the we're in the base directory for the whole system.

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,180
OK.

127
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,280
See if we can go any higher we go C.D dot dot.

128
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,510
You can see that we can't go any higher because the dust the slush folder is the highest point on the

129
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,430
file system.

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,020
OK.

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,270
And we can actually have a look around if I do an ls what's in the base directory.

132
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,670
See there's quite a lot of files here that you saw when we had a little bit of next mation of the file

133
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:30,070
system you've got the bin folder the boot folder the folder the ETSI folder which is full of your configuration

134
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,730
files.

135
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,530
The home folder which is where we just were to get our home stuff.

136
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,060
The library's media which is where you have your room remove wardrobe's your optional stuff.

137
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,030
The route users home folder and so on.

138
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:49,150
So on the variable files temp files user stuff and so on and so on I guess these are the folders and

139
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,050
the most important of these anyway are the ones that I gave you a cheat sheet where we talked about

140
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,670
the file system.

141
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,160
OK.

142
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,880
And see what happens.

143
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,110
This is the root user's home folder right.

144
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,650
This is the home folder for the administrator.

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,450
Let's try and see what happens if we try to enter it.

146
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,160
If we do see the route OK and press enter you can see that we get permission denied.

147
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,340
OK so there's some folders that you were allowed into and some folders that you're not allowed into.

148
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,250
So we don't have enough privileges to be able to access the root user's home directory.

149
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,760
Well what about the ETSI folder OK along with the configuration files as try that.

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,670
If we try CD and see how we can get into that one let's see what's in there for us.

151
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,530
Ls us who you can see the whole bunch of stuff in there right.

152
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,030
And you get some folders in here.

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,040
The blue ones or folders and the white ones files and some of them have different types as well.

154
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,430
But you don't have to worry about that.

155
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,430
Mostly what you'll see are blue and white blue ones folders white one files and you can enter anything

156
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,060
that you want in there.

157
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,130
For example there's one here where are we looking.

158
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,270
There's one here called DHC pay we could go into that folder.

159
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,710
We could try CD DHC page.

160
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,720
OK.

161
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,060
Now what's in there.

162
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,340
We could do ls and we can have a look around we can see this other stuff in there.

163
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,250
There's another one there.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,580
De D.H. climbed and to hook day.

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,040
Let's try to get the D.H. client dash and dash hooks.

166
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,410
You can see that we're in there what's in there two Ls we see this other stuff in there.

167
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,020
The green ones here are programs but you can see here right the way that we are moving around the file

168
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,820
system using either CD to move LS to see what's around us or Peter Beattie to confirm exactly where

169
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,620
we are.

170
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,420
And it's this way that you will actually move around the entire system and it doesn't change no matter

171
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,560
where you are as long as you've got the permissions to enter those folders you can get there using just

172
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,820
the cd command and you can look around using the ls command and you can confirm where you are using

173
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,260
the Pido EDI command.

174
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,790
Now how do we get all the way back to our home folder.

175
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,850
Very easy just press CD press enter and we are back in our home folder.

176
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,290
So you can see the pretty much anything that you need to do in the Linux file system anywhere in the

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,710
expansion that you want to move to as long as you have the required permissions on the CD.

178
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,750
LS And Peter really commands and you can get wherever you want and if you get lost or shoes the Pido

179
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,910
E-D command to check where you are pretty epic right.

180
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,460
So now that we're back in our home folder there's one final thing that I want to teach you.

181
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,940
And that's called tab completion.

182
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,190
But for goodness as well as a summary of everything we've learned in the past few videos I'll see you

183
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,600
in the next video.
