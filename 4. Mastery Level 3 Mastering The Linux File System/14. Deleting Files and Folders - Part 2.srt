00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,450
And welcome to this video where we're going to be finishing off our discussion of how to delete files

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,900
and directories using the command line.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,250
So in this video you're going to learn how to use the Ahram and are MDR commands to delete folders.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,140
And by the end of this video you'll know pretty much everything you need to know about deleting files

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,330
and folders using the command line.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,260
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,940
All right so let's start off by creating a folder in our home directory called Del folder.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,730
So if I use the mkdir command and type Del folder we'll see that we created a new folder inside our

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,530
home directory called Del folder.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,040
OK.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,320
So let's remove it.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,160
OK now all we have to do actually to remove it is use the r.m command again for use Ahram and use del

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,270
folder and press enter.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,140
We actually get an error.

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,940
Now this is because yes we will use the r.m command but in order for the R M command to remove folders

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:08,950
we need to give the r.m command the r option but the r option stands for recursive or recursively.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:16,110
Now if you delete something recursively that means you'll delete that thing and everything else inside

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,520
of it.

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,260
So if we try that now our ram slash our and then del folder OK and press enter.

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,730
We'll see now that Del folder has indeed been deleted.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,970
So let's make it again make it again make Del folder OK and let's make some more folders inside of it.

23
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,280
So we're going to use brace expansion for this now.

24
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,800
OK.

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,360
We can do make make directory Del folder and inside there we're going to make three folders called Delete

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,990
me one two and three.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,560
OK.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,170
So if I press enter and take a look at Dell folder we can see we've got the lead me want to get me to

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,160
and delete me 3.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,630
So that's how this works.

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,310
We made first it made me want inside of Dell for that then it may delete me too.

32
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,220
Then it made delete me 3 comsats brace expansion again.

33
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,900
So let's make some files inside each of those.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:14,810
So if we touch Dell folder delete me delete me one two and three and then inside of their make file

35
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,380
one two and three.

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,000
And now if we take a look we can see and delete me one.

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,280
We've got four one two and three and delete me 2 for 1 2 and 3 and then delete me 3.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,100
We've got file 1 2 and 3.

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:33,460
So now if we if we go ahead and if we just look we've got Del folder here we've got Dell folder in our

40
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,270
home directory.

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:42,310
Now if we use our ram with the option to delete that Del folder remember to delete something recursively

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,330
means to delete it and everything else inside of it.

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:54,100
So if I use r.m with the option and give it Delphos then press enter will see that folder has indeed

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,300
been deleted and so has everything else inside of it.

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,330
Now one thing you might notice is that the r.m command when it did that it actually didn't give us any

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,880
warning.

47
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,720
It just went ahead and deleted everything inside the Dell folder folder.

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,270
OK.

49
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,030
Now because of this our ram dash on em with the corruption is a very powerful command that should be

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,010
dealt with very carefully especially when you start using the Star wild card as well.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,480
All things can go wrong and you can find yourself just deleting everything and not being able to get

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,820
your files back which is sad sad times.

53
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,780
So for example if I do go ahead and do that now if I just delete that on everything on our system right

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,110
now I'm not going to do it I'm joking.

55
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:42,160
So one way to make the argument safer is actually to give it the option.

56
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,900
OK.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,470
So the option stands for interactive and this will make the r in command askew interactively.

58
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,320
Whether to delete each file or not.

59
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,420
Now at the moment we don't have we don't have the Dell folder anymore.

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,440
So to make Dell folder and delete me one two and three all at once.

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm going to use the make the command give it the option which allows you to create an entire path and

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,850
do Del too and Telic create delete me 1 2 and 3.

63
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,560
So if I do that actually not dealt too.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
Sorry Dell folder.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,140
OK then I get Dell folder inside there that me wanted me to do it three can call right now let's create

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,020
the files inside Besso Dell folder forward slash delete me one two and three and we're going to make

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,710
file one two and three and so each of those and so each of those We've got our files back.

68
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,260
OK.

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,850
So there we are.

70
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,730
Didn't take too long at all.

71
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,110
We've got our files back by the way.

72
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,140
Can you see just how much quicker this is than pointing and clicking.

73
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,240
We created all those files without ever even needing to enter the folders which created them right from

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,400
a home directory.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,880
So.

76
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,150
So cool.

77
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,930
So now if we tried to delete everything again try and delete Del folder by giving the command the R

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,620
and R options.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,190
OK it doesn't matter which order you do it.

80
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,130
So we give it Del folder we'll see that.

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:12,250
Now it's asking permission for us to actually delete things so it's saying Can I go into Dell folder.

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,380
Let's tell it yes.

83
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,120
OK.

84
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,220
It will now say can I go in to delete me one.

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,020
Let's say yes.

86
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,000
And can I delete a file too.

87
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,720
Yes you can can delete 4:03 three.

88
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,210
Yes she can cannot delete for one inside.

89
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,800
Delete me want if she can can I remove the directory delete me one.

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Yes she can.

91
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,520
Can I go into delete any three.

92
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,270
You see it's not particularly doing it in any order but it's asking you before it does it.

93
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,900
OK.

94
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,390
So say yes you can do it that you can delete that you can do that.

95
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,570
Now let's leave it let's leave file to inside delete me too.

96
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,150
OK.

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,810
So you can delete delete me 3.

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,570
Going to delete me too.

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,410
No don't delete fall.

100
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,040
Yes delete 5:3 yes to the for one.

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,510
No don't delete the entire folder no don't delete folder and that's it.

102
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,840
Kate said if we look inside Dell folder we should see delete me too.

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,250
And Faltu still leftover.

104
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,560
OK so that's quite cool right.

105
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,570
You can control what the command deletes But this is kind of tedious right saying yes and no every time

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,800
it's a.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,350
If you had a lot of files that would that would really be a massive hassle.

108
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,110
So fortunately there's another command that specialized for only removing directories that are empty

109
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,150
now because this command only removes empty directories.

110
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,670
This means that you can tell it to delete everything.

111
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,380
It will only delete the folders that are actually empty.

112
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,770
Which means you'll never delete a file accidentally.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,060
And that command is called the MDI or the remove directory command set to see the remove directory command

114
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,840
in action.

115
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,730
First let's go ahead and delete everything inside Dell folder remove recursively DLL folder and Ardell

116
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,770
folder has been deleted.

117
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,130
Now let's go ahead and create some folders so we're going to use mkdir with the option to create.

118
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,080
Let's call it Dell folder and then folder one to three.

119
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,800
That's another way of doing it by the way you don't have to type one comma to comma three.

120
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,740
You can just do one dot dot three.

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,280
And if we look in Del folder We've got 4 to 1 vote to vote 3 and as put ten folders inside folders one

122
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,220
and two but not in folder one.

123
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:30,840

124
9:43 says to touch Delph folder folder one too and then put inside their file 1 to 10 to 16.

125
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,770
So if we look inside for the one we've now got 10 text files we look inside for the two.

126
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,400
We've got 10 text files in folder 3.

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,760
We don't have any.

128
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,510
OK so now we've got three folders inside Dell folder folders want to follow to have 10 files in them

129
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,020
but folder 3 is completely empty.

130
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:58,030
Now if I tried to do remove directory and I say remove directory Del folder slash everything.

131
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,340
OK what we're saying here is delete everything inside Del folder.

132
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,310
Delete the empty folders inside folder.

133
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,100
Basically if I do that will see it failed to remove folder one because the directory is not empty it

134
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,990
failed to remove folder too because the director is not empty but 2:56 has indeed been deleted.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,000
So just so you know this wouldn't have worked if we'd just done remove directory of Dell folder without

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,070
putting the star CC we've got the star asterisk wildcard here.

137
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,960
If we just have removed Delph folder the shuttle site.

138
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,640
But Dell folders not empty.

139
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,960
How can I just delete it.

140
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:42,080
Well what we did is we said remove everything that is inside Dell folder that is empty.

141
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,540
OK so we have to have the star there to make that work.

142
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,280
That's just something to bear in mind.

143
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,820
OK so one final challenge in the last video we created a project folder that had a whole bunch of other

144
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,450
folders inside we'd like a jillion files.

145
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,400
Ok you must remember this for the last few videos.

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,310
Now what I want you to do is I want to try and delete all of those folders and directories and files

147
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,190
and stuff in one command.

148
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,980
OK so that's your challenge.

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,550
That's natural challenge you've got to try and delete the entire project folder with everything inside

150
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,070
of it all the thousands of files in one command so.

151
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,540
Post the video now and see if you can figure out figure out how to do it.

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,260
Then come back and see how you did.

153
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Did you manage it.

154
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,890
If so.

155
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,130
Well done you learn super super quick.

156
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,460
So here is how I do it.

157
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,880
OK now I have the folder was called Project write it was on the desktop such shift there.

158
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,940
It's it's called Project.

159
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:50,490
So we want to delete everything so we don't want to use the R MDR command because that only deletes

160
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,540
empty directories.

161
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,750
We want to use the r.m command instead because we want to delete directories that have stuff in them.

162
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,850
OK now we want to delete the project folder and everything inside it.

163
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,980
So we need to delete recursively so to do that we're going to use the r option.

164
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,710
OK.

165
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,040
And putting it all together basically means we'll just do remove recursively the project folder.

166
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,900
Or if I was in my home directory like this I would remove recursively desktop's slash project.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,730
OK just given the path to that folder and when I press enter.

168
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,030
As if by magic.

169
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,540
However many folders there were the thousands of files have been deleted.

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:40,050
How absolutely epic is that so that'll just about wrap up our discussion of deleting files and folders

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,460
using the command line.

172
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:47,640
So in this video you learn that the r.m command needs the option in order to delete folders and the

173
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,750
option stands for recursive deleting.

174
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,460
So delete something recursively means to delete that thing and everything else inside it.

175
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,590
And this is what you need to be especially careful when using the option because you can end up deleting

176
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:08,400
stuff that you didn't want to know one way to make that a bit safer is to use the option for the r.m

177
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,020
command which will allow the r.m command to be interactive when it does it's deleting.

178
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:21,120
So this is where you can say yes or no to each file folder being deleted but the best thing is there's

179
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,620
not really much you can rely on.

180
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,020
Just be careful when doing your deleting.

181
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,440
OK.

182
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:31,500
But the safest of all options is to use the R MDR command which will only delete folders that are empty.

183
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,910
So if you just want to do a bit of tidying up and delete folders that don't have anything in them you

184
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,510
can use the MDR command.

185
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,180
And rest assured that you won't delete any data.

186
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,190
So coming up next we're going to discuss how you might copy and paste files and directories using the

187
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,790
command line.

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,870
So instead of cutting our file tree we're going to make it grow.

189
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
