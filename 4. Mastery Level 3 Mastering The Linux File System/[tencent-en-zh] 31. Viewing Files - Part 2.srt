1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,340
你好，你们这些漂亮的人。
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,410
欢迎回来。
And welcome back.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,780
因此，在上一个视频中，您学习了如何使用几个命令打开文件并读取其内容
So in the last video you learned how to open files and read their contents by using several command

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,030
行命令，例如cat命令将打开一个文件，并允许我们读取其内容。
line commands So for example the cat command will open up a file and allow us to read its content.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,150
所以如果我们用来表示1.60，我们可以看到它包含单词Hello。
So if we use for a 1.60 we can see that it contains the word Hello.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,130
当我们像这样打开文件时，所有内容都会同时显示出来。
And when we open files like this what happens is everything is shown all at once.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,170
因此，无论文件有多长，它都会被直接吐到我们的终端中，这是一种善意的做法
So no matter how long the file is it will all be spat out right into our terminal and that can be kind

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,740
痛苦的感觉。
of pain.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,020
例如，如果我们试图打开一个非常长的文件，比如我在上一篇文章中展示的文件
So for example if we try to open up a really long file such as the file that I showed you in the last

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,160
与您系统中的打印机和设备有关的视频。
video which has something to do with printers and stuff on your system.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,980
所以如果我输入的话警察就会浏览网站。
So if I typed that in so cops browsed dot com.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,680
好的。
OK.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,060
我试着打印。
And I try to print.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,870
你可以看到我们刚刚拍摄了一大堆信息。
You can see that we've just shot a whole bunch of information.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,090
如果我们想要阅读它，我们必须在命令行中像这样上下滚动。
And if we want to read it we've got to scroll up and down like this right in our command line.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,380
就像这样有点痛苦，这不是一种很好的方式。
It's a bit of a pain right like this not really a nice way.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
您希望能够处理长文件。
You want to be able to deal with the long files.

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,030
因此，为了帮助实现这一点，Linux上有一些称为分页程序的程序，它们允许您翻页
So to help with this there are programs on Linux called pager programs that allow you to page through

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,540
较大的输出，使其更易于阅读。
large output to make it easier to read.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,920
我们将在这段视频中介绍的是最后一个命令。
And the one that we'll be covering in this video is called the last command.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,550
因此，如果我们只是做，而不是猫，如果我们做得更少，然后给它我们想要读的父亲，你可以看到
So if we just do instead of cat if we do less and then give it the father we want to read you can see

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,760
现在的情况是，我们首先在文件的顶部进行排序，只需使用我们的键盘
now what's happening is we are we sorted first of all at the top of the file and by just using our keyboard

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,110
向上和向下的键或箭头键，我们可以滚动浏览此内容并阅读，还可以上上下下骑车阅读
keys or arrow keys up and down we can scroll through this content and read it and bicycling up and down

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,190
这比我们只在命令行中使用它容易得多，如果我按Q，您可以在底部看到它
a lot easier than if we had it just on the command line and if I press Q You can see it on the bottom

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,010
嘿，我们有这两个冒号，如果我键入q，它就会关闭。
Hey we got these two colons if I type q it closes.

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,810
然后他们又重新开机了。
And they were back on.

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,320
来吧，我的，没有乱七八糟的，我们必须滚动通过。
Come on my with no mess that we have to scroll through.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,520
所以这是一个很好的方法。
So that's a nice way of doing it.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,140
实际上，您可以通过管道连接到最后一个命令，所以我可以使用它，而不是直接打开它
And actually you can pipe to the last command so instead of opening it directly about I could use that

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,490
打开文件，然后通过管道进入最后一个命令，它会给我们相同的结果。
to open the file and then pipe into the last command and it will give us the same result.

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,790
现在，这种通过管道连接到最后一个命令的能力非常有用，因为它不一定要
Now this ability to pipe to the last command is incredibly useful because it doesn't just have to be

32
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,800
您正在处理的文件。
files that you are that you are dealing with.

33
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,380
例如，如果我说OK，让我们进入我们的主目录，找到所有的文本文件。
For example if I said OK let's come into our into our home directory and let's find all the text files.

34
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,010
好的，我们要按名字找到所有以点TXI结尾的东西。
Ok so we're going to find by name everything that ends in Dot TXI.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,940
好的。
OK.

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,130
我们看到我们在这里得到了一大堆信息，这可能需要相当长的时间。
And we see that we get a whole bunch of information here and this could be quite long.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,420
可能会有很多东西。
It could it could be quite a lot of stuff.

38
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,440
但是我们要做的是，我们要做的不是，实际上攻击的结束是
But what we're going to do is we're going to instead of that actually the end of just attacks is to

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,290
试着找出一切都好，它打印了一大堆东西，我们必须滚动浏览。
try and find everything OK it's printed out a whole bunch of stuff that we've got to scroll through.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,990
取而代之的是，我们可以用管道把它换成更少的。
Instead of that we can just pipe it into less.

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,850
现在我们可以逐行滚动。
And now we can scroll through line by line.

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,560
最后这条注释在使用命令行时非常有用，因为它使您
So this last comment is a really useful one when working with the command line because it saves you

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,290
因为你的屏幕上到处都是乱七八糟的东西。
from having a lot of mess filling up your screen.

44
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,590
好的。
OK.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,950
给它铺设管道真的很有用。
And piping to it is is really really really useful.

46
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,350
我们能解救的案子和所有乱七八糟的东西现在都没了。
The cases that we can to rescue and all the mess has gone now.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,550
有时，您不想要整个小时或整个文件，而只想对其中的一部分进行操作
Sometimes you don't want the whole hour or the whole file and you only want to operate on a piece of

48
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,760
它。
it.

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,130
好的，那么也许您想从文件中提取一小部分，并将其通过您的管道进行传递
OK so perhaps you want to take a little piece from a file and pass it through your pipeline instead

50
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,810
整个文件都在你的屏幕上，你只想在上车前浏览一小段
of having the whole file on your screen and you just want to peek at a little piece before getting on

51
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,710
你的工作。
with your work.

52
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,440
因此，出于此目的，我们可以使用head命令允许您执行的head和ail命令
So for this purpose we can use the head and the tail commands that the head command will allow you to

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,140
看到从文件顶部或头部开始的一小段文件，Tail命令将
see a little piece of the file starting at the top or the head of the file and the tail command will

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,140
反其道而行之。
do the opposite.

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,710
它希望看到文件的一小部分从文件的底部或尾部开始。
It would like to see a little piece of the file starting at the bottom or at the tail of the file.

56
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,380
好的。
OK.

57
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,900
例如，让我们再次将以下文件连接在一起，我将转到我们的桌面
So for example let's concatenate together the following files again I'm going to get to our desktop

58
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:50,490
清空屏幕，我要把文件，哎呀，剪辑放在一起，一个文件到一个文件
and clear the screen and I'm going to cut together files oops clips being kept together files one to

59
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,140
五。
five.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,600
好的。
OK.

61
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,520
那需要两个人。
That takes two.

62
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,150
我们看到我们排出了五排。
And we see that we get five rows out.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,810
好的。
OK.

64
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,620
现在，如果我把它输入head命令，我们就会得到相同的输出。
Now if I just pipe this into the head command we just get the same output.

65
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,630
那为什么呢。
So why is that.

66
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,530
这是因为head命令在默认情况下是文件的前10行
Well that's because the head command were by default so we the first 10 lines of a file and since there

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,110
只有5行，我们将看到所有内容，但是我们可以通过指定需要的行数来编辑此行为
are only five we'll see it all but we can edit this behavior by specifying how many lines that we want

68
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,700
去看看。
to see.

69
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,990
所以如果我按下路障来得到我们想要的，我就可以发表仇恨言论
So if I just press the barricades to get what we want I can give the the hate speech that had come out

70
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,670
并指定我们想要查看的行数，这样我们将只看到前两行
of the option and specify how many rows we want to see so we're just going to see the first two lines

71
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,770
你们会看到我们开始了，我们只看到Hello在那里，输出的前两行。
and you'll see that we go we just see Hello in there the first two lines of the output.

72
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,770
现在，head命令在管道中再次非常有用。
Now the head command is very useful in pipeline's again.

73
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,230
假设我们正在执行find命令，我们回到主目录并运行find命令
Let's say we were doing the find command and we're back in our home directory and we run the find command

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,250
我们得到了一大堆输出，假设您只想要这些选项中的前五个选项
we get a whole bunch of output and let's say you just wanted the first five of these options you can

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,700
只需通过管道将其发送给head命令，给它一个选项，然后说，嘿，我只需要五行代码。
just pipe it to the head command give it an option and say Hey I just want five lines.

76
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,820
让我按Enter键。
Let me press enter.

77
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,270
你看，我们开始了，我们得到了前五个结果，然后你可以把这些结果放下来
And you see there we go we get the first five results and then you can take those and pipe them down

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,860
不管你想要什么原因都会顺着管道走下去。
down the then the pipeline for whatever reason you wanted.

79
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,220
所以也许我想，你知道，然后Paso进入任务指挥部，颠倒他们所处的顺序
So maybe I wanted to you know then Paso's into the task command and reverse the order that they're in

80
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,330
或者不管它是什么。
or whatever it might be.

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,800
好的。
OK.

82
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,460
所以这是HEAD命令的一个非常有用的应用程序，它的工作原理与Tail命令相同，但是
So that's a really useful application of the head command that works the same for the tail command but

83
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,930
Tail命令将从底部而不是从顶部向您显示。
the tail command will show you from the bottom rather than from the top.

84
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,470
但我想告诉你的是，实际上你不需要直接用管子砸脑袋，来吧，你可以做手术
But I want to show you that actually you don't need to just pipe to the head come on you can operate

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,900
直接放在文件上。
directly on files.

86
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:30,350
所以我们有一个很长的落差，不是吗，我们有，它是在C杯，杯子，浏览网站。
So we had that really long fall didn't we we had it was slush at C cups cups browsed dot com.

87
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,520
你看，我们有很长很长的档案。
And you see we got this really really long file.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,460
现在，如果我们可以通过管道将其传递给字数统计命令，并给它
Now if we can actually see how long that is by piping that to the word count command and giving it the

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,890
选项，就像你在课程前面看到的，你可以看到我们有673行，相当多
option like you've seen a bit earlier in the course you can see we've got 673 lines that's quite a few

90
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,560
台词。
lines.

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,250
但如果我们只想要前20条线路和一套管道呢？
But what if we just want the first 20 lines with a set of piping it.

92
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,290
我们没必要这么做。
We don't have to do that.

93
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,210
我们能做的就是说Head得到前20名的选择权，然后把它给外国人
What we can do is we can just say head get the option of the first 20 and then give it the foreigners

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,110
直接操作，我们将只得到前20条线路，我们可以确认我们确实有
operate directly on and we will get just the first 20 lines and we can confirm that we do indeed have

95
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,750
20行，按此处的向上箭头键，然后使用选项向右输送到字数统计命令
20 lines by pressing the up arrow key here and piping right to the word count command with the option

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,650
来计算线条的数量，我们会看到这一点。
to count the amount of lines and we'll see that up.

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,010
我们现在只有20行输出。
We do now only have 20 lines of output.

98
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,180
所以这很完美。
So that's perfect.

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,060
现在，除了从底部开始之外，Tail命令的工作方式与HEAD命令基本相同
Now the tail command works basically the same way as the head command except it starts from the bottom

100
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,340
一份文件。
of a file.

101
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:29,450
如果我们再做一次选角，我们就会回到桌面上，我们的卡托文件4：59停靠在这里。
So if we do our casting again we get back to the desktop and we Cateau file 4:59 docked here.

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,640
我们会看到这一点的，但我们还是会向你们打招呼的，你们这些漂亮的人。
And we'll see that yet we get hello you beautiful people.

103
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,070
如果我们把它告诉尾部指挥官，说我们只想要最下面的两条线，那么我们就
And if we pipe it into the tail commander and say we just want the bottom two lines then we'll just

104
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,060
找漂亮的人来。
get beautiful people.

105
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,810
所以最下面的两条线。
So the bottom two lines.

106
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,300
好的。
OK.

107
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,980
如果我们再一次对非常长的文件进行操作，所以不是用现金而不是
And if we again we're operating on the really really long file so instead of having cash instead of

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,820
有了头，让我们有尾，去掉这个单词的尾数。
having head let's have tail get rid of this word count at the end.

109
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,200
现在，如果我们按Enter键，您可以看到我们只得到最下面的20行，我们可以再次通过管道
Now if we if we press ENTER you can see that we just get the bottom 20 lines and we can again pipe that

110
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,740
进入字数统计，可以看到，是的，我们确实有20行。
into word count and see that yes we do indeed have 20 lines.

111
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:08,450
因此Head和Tail分别剪切文件的顶部或底部，以精确控制
So head and tail to cut either the top of a file or the bottom of a file respectively to control exactly

112
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,060
你想要什么。
what you want.

113
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,860
你可以把这些组合在一起，形成过滤的特定线条。
And you can use these together to kind of filter out specific lines.

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,480
好的。
OK.

115
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:23,010
所以让我们说我们做了，让我们回到头的例子，让我们假设我们去掉了前20行。
So let's say we did let's go back to our head example and let's say that we cut out the first 20 lines.

116
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,250
好的。
OK.

117
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,970
这是那个又大又长的文件的前20行。
These are the first 20 lines of that big long file.

118
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:35,290
然后，如果我把它输入Tail命令，而盖茨说，好的，只给我从底部算起一行。
And then if I pipe that into the tail command and Gates said OK give me just one line from the bottom.

119
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,010
好的，那么这里的这个空格将是文件的第20行。
OK then this blank here is going to be the 20th line of the file.

120
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,810
也许这不是那么令人兴奋，比方说，如果我得到3个好的。
Maybe it's not that exciting let's say if I get say three OK.

121
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,230
这将给我提供文件的第18、19和20行。
That's going to give me lines 18 19 and 20 of the file.

122
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,990
您可以用这种方式使用命令来删除特定的行。
And you can use the commands in this way to cut out specific lines.

123
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,600
好的，这就是一个非常有用的组合。
OK so that's that's quite a useful combination right there.

124
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,540
但这些东西真正发挥作用的地方是在你建造管道的时候。
But really where these things come into coming to their real use is when you are building your pipeline.

125
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,820
因此，我一直使用并依赖的示例是find命令，因为它为我们提供了大量输出
So the example I've been using and leaning on is the find command because it gives us a lot of output

126
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,140
但是你知道，如果你只想要一组特定的线条，比如说我想要最后三条线条，我可以
but you know if you wanted to just get a specific set of lines say I wanted the last three lines I could

127
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,610
只需将这些输入到Tail命令中，然后说OK，只需给我最后三行，然后继续
just pipe those into the tail command and just say OK just give me the last three lines and then continue

128
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:28,940
要将其记录下来，甚至将其导出，让我们比方说，将桌面上的文本导出，然后您
to pipe that down or even export it lets say into export the text on our on our desktop and then you

129
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,790
我可以保存并保留您想要的行，而不是必须有一大堆输出
can save up and keep just the lines that you want rather than having to have a whole bunch of output

130
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,730
你不需要的东西。
that you don't need.

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,070
好的，就像过滤一样。
OK so it's like a filter.

132
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,620
Head和土库曼人最好被视为过滤器，让你的管道能让你得到你想要的东西
The head and Turkomans are best seen as filters that allow your pipelines to get you just what you want

133
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,470
一起工作。
to work with.

134
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,150
所以我们在过去的几个视频中有相当多的东西，对吧。
So we've got quite a lot of stuff in the past few videos right.

135
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,270
但幸运的是，这些都不是特别复杂，但都非常有用。
But fortunately none of it is particularly complicated but it's all very useful.

136
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,330
简单回顾一下，您已经了解了如何使用cat命令将文件连接在一起或连接文件
So as a quick recap you've seen how to join files together or concatenate files using the cat command

137
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,880
这是一个很棒的工具，不仅可以联合起来，还可以让您获取错误的内容
which is a great tool for not only joining forces but also allowing you to take a false content and

138
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,900
将其直接放入标准输出，以便在您的管道中使用。
putting it right into standard output so that it can be used in your pipelines.

139
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,480
您还了解了如何垂直反转文件。
You've also seen how you can reverse files vertically.

140
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,020
因此，使用TAC命令，您还了解了如何使用以下命令在各行之间水平反转文件
So using the TAC command and you've also seen how to reverse files horizontally across their lines using

141
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,770
使用ref命令并同时使用这两个命令是将您的文件弄乱的一种非常好的方法。
the ref command and using both of those together is a real good way to jumble up your files.

142
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,970
现在，您想要读取的一些文件非常长，只能用Capcom查看它们的内容
Now some files that you want to read are very very long and just viewing their contents with the Capcom

143
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,240
举个例子，它有点乱七八糟的，给你提供了很多你必须滚动浏览的东西。
and for example is a bit of a mess and it gives you a lot of stuff you've got to scroll through.

144
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,730
因此，您了解了如何使用less命令对大量输出或来自的大文件进行分页
So you saw how to use the less command to page through massive amounts of output or large files from

145
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,790
命令行，不需要创建不必要的文件，只需查看命令的输出和管道
the command line without needing to make unnecessary files just to view the output and piping from commands

146
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,440
到最后一条命令是保持终端整洁和提高工作流程效率的好方法
to the last command is a great way to keep your terminal tidy and make your workflow more effective

147
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,990
使处理大量数据变得更容易。
and just make dealing with large amounts of data a lot easier to handle.

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,610
最后，您了解了如何使用Head和Tail命令从文件中剪切出您想要的内容。
And finally you saw how to use the head and tail commands to cut out just what you want from a file.

149
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,130
你知道，如果你愿意的话，那就直接把它传到你的管道里。
And you know if you would like then pass it straight on down your pipeline.

150
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,340
因此，这些都是非常有用的工具，在处理文件内容时会经常派上用场。
So these are really really useful tools that will come in handy quite often when working with file content.

151
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,890
现在，您不仅知道如何整体操作文件，也知道如何复制整个文件、移动整个文件、删除整个文件
So now you not only know how to manipulate files as a whole so copy a whole file move a whole file delete

152
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,700
整个文件，但现在您知道如何对其内容进行更多操作。
the whole file but now you know how to operate a bit more on their contents.

153
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,290
但是，您可以对文件内容做的事情太多了，只需简单地查看或粘贴它们即可
But there's so much more that you can do with file contents and simply just looking at them or sticking

154
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,990
他们在一起。
them together.

155
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,920
在下一个视频中，您将了解如何按字母顺序对命令文件内容进行排序
So in the next video you're going to learn how you can sort a command files contents either alphabetically

156
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,550
或者用数字表示，并且能够对内容进行排序是非常有用的。
or numerically and being able to sort content's is super useful.

157
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,900
它使查找您想要的东西变得更容易，并且与HEAD等命令完美地配合使用
It makes finding what you're looking for easier and works perfectly alongside commands such as the head

158
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,090
和我们在这段视频中看到的尾部命令来进行非常强大的组合，忘记了
and tail commands that we've seen in this video to make really powerful combinations forgetting just

159
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,380
你想从一个文件里得到什么。
what you want out of a file.

160
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,390
因此，这将是史诗般的文件分类是一项非常非常有用的能力。
So this is going to be epic sorting files is just a really really useful ability.

161
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,950
好了，我会在下一个视频中见到你。
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
