00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,810
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,500
And welcome back we're going to be continuing our discussion of the find command and how we can control

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,740
the search depth.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,640
The find command searches too.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,930
So if I open up our file Explora I've made a few few new folders.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,460
So in our documents folder I have made a folder called Level 2.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,320
And inside there I've got a file called to text.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,110
And then a folder called Level 3 and it's either I've got a file called 3 that he actually then Level

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,570
4 for 4.6 state level 5 and 5.10 60 where it ends.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,770
OK and we're going to be using this to take a look at how we can control the search depth that the find

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,590
command searches too.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,150
So all of that stuff is in our documents folder and you can see here I'm going to change into our documents

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,540
folder and use an ls and you can see that level 2 is in there.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,210
So this is what we're seeing at the minute.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,590
This is what we are currently in.

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,090
Like I said Clay the screen and start a discussion.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,460
If I just run the find command from here the find command will search to an infinite depth.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,860
It will list every file and every folder.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,500
From this point in the file system.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,380
OK so from here and downwards so if I run that you'll see it shows us Level 2 and it will show us everything

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,470
inside there.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,230
So you'll see we get to up to 60 and it shows a level 3 3.6 16 level for 4.6 level 5 and 5.20 everything

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,530
is shown in there.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,620
But we can control the depth of the come on searches too by using the max depth option.

25
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,080
So let me show you how we do that.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,270
So if we type find We're going to again start from our current working directory we can actually specify

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,460
that to make it a bit clearer by using the dot by the way remember dot means this directory.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,170
So I'm actually going to use this from now on I'm just going to always start by saying OK start from

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,250
this directory by using the dot.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,710
OK.

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,620
So the max depth option you type 1 dash and then max depth and you can specify the depth here so let's

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,760
say we put 1.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,020
So the first thing you might notice is Ziyad Why is that just one dash of what you said for long form

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,770
options.

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,920
These have two dashes.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Well that's right.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,340
But for the finite amount you only have one dash for these options.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,290
OK because so many of them the so many long form options I guess they tried to save you typing by just

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,270
reducing it to one dash.

40
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,690
OK.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,500
So here we are we have just one dash max depth and then one and this is say on research to a maximum

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,090
depth of 1.

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,430
Really.

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,080
So if we see that we'll see what happens.

45
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,990
You see here that we only see the level 2 folder.

46
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:37,250
So a max depth of 1 is just like seeing what you see here it only shows you what is in the current directory.

47
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,210
OK now if I do max depth of two that's like showing you what's here and what's one level down.

48
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,160
OK so if we if we take a look here what we should see is we should see Level 2 and then it will go inside

49
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,860
and it will show you 2.6 T.

50
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm the level 3 folder because if we run that Muxtape have to level 2 which is here it's showing us

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,940
the level 2 folder.

52
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,150
This is where we start shoguns level 2 Walda going in there.

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,530
She goes to the up to 60 and level 3.

54
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,940
So we see the level 2 folder to 60 and level 3.

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,480
OK.

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,010
Now if we want to go to max depth of three that's going to go down another level into Level 3.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,540
Ok so for Rama we'll see that we see three that takes T level the level 4 folder shown as well.

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,720
If we keep going deeper we do Max up the four.

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,740
We're now starting to take a look inside level 4 we're seeing 4.6 T and the level 5 folder.

60
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,210
And if we do Muxtape the 5 it's going to go down even further all the way until we see 5.6.

61
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,810
And you can give it like you know a max depth of 100 and it will still work because all you're defining

62
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,310
is a maximum depth.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,880
OK.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,130
It doesn't mean it will go all that way.

65
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,310
That's just as far as it could go if it was possible.

66
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,830
Get there by default.

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,340
And there is no maximum depth.

68
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,260
So it will list everything here.

69
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,690
We don't have to specify a maximum depth if you wanted to go all the way into the factory but if you

70
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,520
want to limit how far it goes that's when you use the max depth option and you say hey I only want you

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,620
to show me what's in this folder.

72
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,260
That's when you use max depth of one and it's incredibly useful for listing out what's in the current

73
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,440
folder.

74
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,560
Now if we just clear the screen there's another really great option that the find command has which

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,910
is the type option.

76
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,730
So if we just go all the way back up to our documents here the type option allows you to search for

77
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,960
just files or just directories notice by default the find command lists both lists both files and directories

78
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,150
but the type that you specify just one.

79
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,840
So if I start here and in our documents folder I list everything starting this fall you see that we

80
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,310
list out the folders and their files.

81
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,430
But if I said OK I just want to list out the files what I do is type the type option with again noticing

82
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,460
just one dash.

83
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,160
And if I just want files I would type f f file.

84
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,620
OK.

85
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:06,720
So if I press Enter now now you'll see that we just get 4.6 take 5.6 take 3.6 D and 2.6.

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,750
We just get the files.

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,620
Likewise I could just get the folders by pressing instead of having f have D.

88
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,440
Like I say if I type D you know when I just get the folders so level 2 folder level 3 folder level 4

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,040
folder and the level 5 folder.

90
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,450
OK.

91
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,070
Starting at this directory here.

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,280
OK.

93
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,740
And you can combine this of course with the max depth option.

94
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,200
OK.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:39,720
So if I do max depth of one now all we're doing is we're going to a maximum depth of 1 and just showing

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,200
the folders.

97
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,970
Now I did this on purpose to show you that if you put them this way around you'll get a warning and

98
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,140
it says warning you have specified the max depth option after a non option argument type but options

99
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,160
are not positional.

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,700
OK I'll tell you what this means shortly.

101
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,510
Really quickly.

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,950
OK what this means is just put max depth first.

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,340
That's what you've got to do.

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,330
And that warning goes away.

105
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,110
So if you're going to specify multiple options you put the max depth first if I could if I clear the

106
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,210
screen you'll see that warning goes away.

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,190
So I was searching to a maximum depth of one and showing all the directories.

108
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,050
That's go to a maximum depth of two.

109
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:24,350
When I was seeing the level 3 folder for this maximum depth for let's say not 42 max depth of four I

110
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,280
see three types of the maximum of three we're going to level three.

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,310
And we're seeing the level four fold up and if we go into the level four folder we'll see a level 5

112
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,240
folder and if we go into the level 5 go to Level 5 it won't make any difference because all that's in

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,060
Level 5 is another file which isn't being shown because all we're looking for is directory's OK.

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,190
So if I go and change that to an F..

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,570
Now you'll see we list all the files and it works exactly the same.

116
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,820
So these are really good options to combine together and there's loads of things that you can do to

117
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,600
customize the way that the find command actually searches.

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,270
But just to quickly summarize that the type option has two possible inputs you could give a F for file

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,400
or D for directory.

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,350
And if you're going to use it with the find command.

121
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,330
Make sure that you give it the max depth option first.

122
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:17,690
OK.

123
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,590
And if you're going to specify where to start from.

124
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,900
Make sure that comes as well so if we're going to do in ETSI folder I'm going to list every single file

125
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,920
in the SC folder.

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,660
Let's say but only to a maximum depth of 1.

127
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,510
There you are.

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,630
This is every single file that is in the ETSI folder.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,950
And you just clear the screen and do that.

130
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,610
This is every single file MENC folder without any directories.

131
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,940
And if we just want to see the directories then here they are.

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,280
So that's a very useful combination of commands to have there.

133
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,100
And it will come very useful in your assignment.

134
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,880
So I'm going to break this video here keep it nice and short and sweet and the next video we're going

135
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,570
to pick up with some more awesome stuff you can do with the find command.
