00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,660
大家好，美女们，欢迎收看这个视频。
Hello you beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,680
您将了解如何使用非常酷的命令行程序从命令行编辑文件
You going to learn how you can edit files from the command line using a really cool command line program

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,140
叫纳诺。
called Nano.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,270
在这段视频和下一段视频中，我将向您展示如何使用名为Nano的命令进行编辑
So in this video and the next video I'm going to show you how you can use a command called Nano to edit

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,550
并使用用户友好的命令行界面创建文件。
and create files using a user friendly command line interface.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,080
在接下来的几个视频结束时，您将了解如何在Nano中编辑文件。
And by the end of the next few videos you're going to know how to edit files in nano.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,270
当您将其与您到目前为止在本节中已经学到的命令相结合时，它是
And when you combine this with the commands that you've already learned so far in this section it's

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,980
很有可能您将能够在没有Linux的情况下完成许多与文件相关的任务
very likely that you'll be able to get many of your file related tasks done with Linux without ever

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,000
必须离开命令行，因此您将能够在Linux上最大限度地提高工作效率。
having to leave the command line and therefore you'll be able to maximize your productivity on Linux.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,340
所以这会很棒的。
So this is going to be awesome.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,590
所以，让我们继续直截了当地谈吧。
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,240
好的。
All right.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,700
在这节课中，我们将使用Nano命令创建一个名为Diary Datti ex-state的文件。
So in this lecture we're going to make a file called Diary Datti ex-state using the Nano command.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,480
现在日记Datti X-C文件实际上还不存在，但是没关系。
Now the diary Datti X-C file doesn't actually exist yet but that's OK.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,670
我们也可以使用Nano创建文件。
We can also create the file using nano.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,920
如果我们输入not，让我们先转到桌面，然后如果我们输入nano
So if we type not let's go to the desktop first let's head over to the desktop and then if we type nano

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,200
日记，XTi博士，好的，我按Enter键。
diary Dr XTi OK and I press enter.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,740
您会注意到，我们的终端已经更改了外观，实际上我们现在正在编辑一个名为diry的文件
You'll notice that our terminal has changed its look and we're actually now editing a file called diry

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,480
正如你在顶部看到的那样，这需要胶带。
that takes tape as you can see at the top.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,330
在Nano编辑器中，您可以在这里看到Nano2.0版本8.6。
In the Nano editor as you can see here nano version 2.0 eight point six.

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,050
显然现在我们可以在这里打任何我们想打的东西了。
Apparently now we can type what ever we want in here.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:36,220
例如，我可以输入hello，我的名字是Ziyad，我教Linux和Python课程等等。
So for example I could type hello my name is Ziyad and I teach Linux and Python courses and more.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,910
好的。
OK.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
它的工作原理与您以前使用过的任何其他图形文本编辑器一样。
And it works just like any other graphical text editor that you've ever used before.

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,100
您可以直接在shell中输入。
And you can just type directly there in the shell.

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,180
现在在底部，您可以看到实际上有一个小工具栏，它告诉您一些事情
Now down the bottom you can see that there's actually a little toolbar that tells you some of the things

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,150
在Nano中可以做到这一点，选项在白色方块中，然后以键盘快捷键的形式出现
that you can do in nano and the options are in the white squares and then in the form of keyboard shortcuts

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,400
单人纸牌，你必须看一看。
solitaire you have to read them.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,820
好的。
OK.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,570
所以在Nano中，你在这里看到的小箭头，小帽子或胡萝卜符号意味着控制
So in nano The little arrowhead that you see here the little hat or the carrot symbol means the control

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,630
键盘上的键。
key on your keyboard.

32
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,920
例如，我们在这里使用了get help命令来获取帮助。
So for example here we have the GET HELP command over to get help.

33
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,010
我猜是工具栏上的选项，给出了这个快捷方式，这里有箭头，然后
I guess option from the toolbar and it's given this this shortcut here it's got the arrow head and then

34
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,360
A大写G。
a capital G.

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,350
所以，如果我们按键盘上的Ctrl键，然后按g键，这就是我们要做的，就是控制Engy
So if we press control on our keyboard and press g which is exactly what we do is just control Engy

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,470
一起执行该命令，我们可以在这里看到，现在在Get Help菜单中
together that executes that command and we can see here that we have now when in the Get Help menu and

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,790
我们可以向下滚动，看到一些有关使用Nano的帮助。
we can scroll down and see some help about using nano.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,640
好的。
OK.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,480
我们在这里可以看到有一些要关闭，我们需要按Ctrl键和X键，因为您
And we can see here that there's some to close this we would need to press control and X because you

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,270
可以看到这个小箭头，然后X服务器控制着X Chewbacca，我们又开始写了。
can see the little arrow and then an X server was controlling X Chewbacca there and we're back writing.

41
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,720
好的。
OK.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,420
我们也可以关闭Nano，例如，通过按Ctrl和X，它会说您想说是还是
We can also close Nano for example by pressing control an X and it will say do you want to say yes or

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,910
不，让我们按控件单击取消，然后看看我们都被取消了，我们还在继续。
no let's just click cancel by control and see that we are both canceled we're still back in.

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,410
好的。
OK.

45
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,880
那么我们怎么才能挽救这个。
So how would we save this.

46
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,220
我们如何将此diry directX t保存到桌面上的主文件夹词汇表中对不起，因为您可以
How do we save this diry directx t in in our home folder glossary on our desktop sorry because you can

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,610
看这上面，店面上说我们在我们的桌面上。
see up here shopfront says that we're in our desktop.

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,190
要在Nano中做到这一点，您需要使用正确的函数。
Well to do that in nano you would use the right function.

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,880
因此，写文件是一种奇特的方式，意思是保存文件，因此保存和写入基本上是一样的
So writing a file is a fancy way of saying saving a file so saving and writing are basically the same

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,590
一件事。
thing.

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,510
所以要写一个文件，我们需要按下Ctrl键，哦，所以我们得到了箭头，小克拉符号
And so to write a file we need to press control and oh so we've got the arrow the little carat symbol

52
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,500
这里的意思是控制键和哦。
here which means the control key and oh.

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,830
所以这意味着我们已经失去了控制。
So that means we've lost control.

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,360
哦，现在它问我们要保存什么，让我们将其保存为日记，然后按Enter键
Oh and now it's asking us what do you want to save as let's save it as diary takes t and we press enter

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,320
它会说它写了三行，但我们在这里可以看到，我们实际上已经得到了Dry dot Txi镜头。
it will say it wrote three lines but we can see here that we've actually got diry dot TXI takes.

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,750
如果我们在任何其他数据中打开该文件，我们可以看到该文件确实已创建。
If we open that in any other data we can see that that file has indeed been created.

57
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,620
所以我可以在这里写一些东西，我可以说，就像你知道的，比如杰克和吉尔上了
So I could write something in here I could say like you know something like Jack and Jill went up the

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,790
小山。
hill.

59
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,340
好的，然后按CONTROL键，再按ENTER键。
All right and then press control and press enter.

60
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,760
如果我按下CONTROL，它就消失了。
And if I press control an x x it OK it's gone away.

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,500
但如果我看一下糖尿病患者的内部，杰克和吉尔上山的数据就是救命稻草。
But if I look inside diabetic's a save that data in that Jack and Jill went up the hill.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,030
因此，Nano是一个文本编辑器，可以通过命令行控制。
So it's the Nano is a text editor that you can control from the command line.

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,160
这不是令人难以置信吗。
So isn't that incredible.

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,540
您现在可以编辑文件，而无需加载图形密集型编辑器。
You can now edit files without needing to load up graphically intensive editors.

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,990
此外，使用这样的文件几乎可以在任何地方工作，即使您可以远程访问
And plus working with files like this will work pretty much anywhere even if you have remotely access

66
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,570
到可能没有安装图形用户界面的服务器。
to a server that might not have a graphical user interface installed.

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,480
Nano等文本编辑器仍可使用。
Text editors such as Nano will still work.

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
那么纳米还能做些什么呢？
So what other things can nano do.

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,390
好的，让我们用我们的方式来选择。
Well let's just work our way across the options.

70
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,250
现在我们已经了解了如何获取帮助，如何退出使用Control和X，以及如何使用
Now we've seen how to get help how to quit using control and X and how to write or save files using

71
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,090
管制编号
control no.

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,370
下面的Lead文件选项怎么样？控件和我们的可读性良好的文件允许您获取内容
What about the lead file option down here the control and our well read file allows you to get content

73
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,870
从另一个文件中取出，然后将其放入这个文件中。
from another file and basically place it inside of this one.

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,890
所以如果我返回到我们的shell，如果我们退出，我们尝试创建一个写有生日快乐的文件，我们
So if I head back to our shell if we exit and we try to create a file that says happy birthday and we

75
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,820
将“生日快乐”放入名为“生日聚会X-C”的文件中，我们可以看到已经创建了生日聚会XTi。
echo happy birthday into a file called birthday party X-C we see the birthday party XTi has been created.

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:26,180
如果我们重新打开，日记本拿起茶，我们走到底部，按下Ctrl键，
If we are back open up again the diary takes tea and we head down the bottom and we press control and

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,470
我们在中的控制是完全读取文件，它会告诉您要插入哪个文件。
our control in our is full read file and it's going to say which file do you want to insert.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,360
注意它说的是来自点劈开。
And notice it says from dot slash.

79
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,550
这意味着从这个目录。
That means from this directory.

80
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,270
好的。
OK.

81
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,800
那么让我们试着把它卖了吧。
So let's let's try and sell it.

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,800
所以你实际插入的是他生日的数据。
So the one you actually insert data from his birthday.

83
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,610
xti.
XTi.

84
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,880
如果我按Enter键，您可以看到刚刚插入了“生日快乐”。
And if I press enter you can see that happy birthday has just been inserted.

85
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,070
这样就开始读取文件了，那么“在哪里”选项呢？
So that started reading files What about the where is option.

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,900
WHERE IS选项是CONTROL和W，它所做的基本上是在您的文件中搜索单词。
Well the where is option is control and W and what that does is basically search for words in your file.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,520
因此，如果我们返回到文件的顶部，然后按Ctrl和W，现在我们就可以搜索单词了
So if we head back up to the top of the file and we press control and W now we can search for words

88
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,690
搜索生日这个词。
that search for the word birthday.

89
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,230
因此，如果我们键入生日并按Enter键，我们现在可以看到Nano已经将我们跳到单词
So if we type birthday and press Enter we now see that Nano has jumped us right down to where the word

90
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,720
生日开始了。
birthday starts.

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,890
这样我们就可以从那里开始编辑了。
And so we can edit it from there on.

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,740
现在，缺省情况下，WHERE IS选项搜索在文件中转发，并且它在不区分大小写的情况下进行搜索
Now by default the where is option search is forward in a file and it searches in a case insensitive

93
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,340
举止。
manner.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,340
所以这意味着大写和小写都无关紧要。
So that means that uppercase and lowercase don't matter.

95
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,690
所以如果我在这里搜索生日或者大写字母。
So if I went up here and I searched for birthday or in uppercase.

96
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,370
实际上，您可以注意到，它会预先显示您搜索的内容。
Actually you can notice that it shows you what you search beforehand.

97
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,410
所以我要把这两个字母都用大写，我们可以看到这实际上并不重要。
So I'm just going to put both in uppercase we can see that it actually didn't matter.

98
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:50,080
它发现了生日，即使它出生的时候都是小写的，所以研究大小写不敏感的地方
And it found birthday even though birth it was all in lowercase So where researches in a case insensitive

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,870
方式和/或默认情况下搜索为正向。
manner and or by default search is forward.

100
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,200
但是如果我们向下到文件的底部，如果我们向下移动并再次使用控件w，您可以
But if we had down to the bottom of the files if we shift down here and use control w again you can

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,660
向下看，如果我最大化屏幕，可能会更清楚地看到，实际上
see down the bottom if I maximize the screen maybe it makes it a bit clearer that there are actually

102
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,270
还会弹出其他选项。
other options that pop up as well.

103
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,150
好的。
OK.

104
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,130
现在，这些选项中有一些以胡萝卜符号心开头，意思是控制键
Now some of these options begin with the the carrot symbol the heart which means the control key but

105
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,170
有些人从这个开始。
some start with this.

106
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,380
M减去。
M minus.

107
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,570
好的，你可以看到em减去C减去或减去B减去J。
OK you can see em minus C minus or minus B minus J.

108
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,840
那么没有负号的负号是什么意思。
So what's the minus mean without minus.

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,330
代表修改。
Stands for modify.

110
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:34,450
这通常是键盘上的Alt键，所以HLT键，所以您可以在这里看到
And this is usually the alt key on your keyboard so the HLT key so you can see here that we've got the

111
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,440
M和减去C选项，表示区分大小写。
M and minus C option which stands for case sensitive.

112
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,880
所以如果我们的媒体Alton‘s See，你可以看到它已经改变了，所以我们现在正在搜索一个案例
So if our press Alton's see you can see now that it has changed so that we are now searching in a case

113
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,170
敏感的方式。
sensitive way.

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,200
好的，如果我现在搜索，请稍等，因为这只是向前搜索，所以我
OK so if I now search for actually hold on as well because this is only going a search forward so I

115
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,720
如果我按ALT并且也要向后搜索，就可以。
can if I press alt and be to search backwards as well.

116
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,340
当我开始搜索区分大小写和向后搜索大写的生日时，我会发现什么都没有
