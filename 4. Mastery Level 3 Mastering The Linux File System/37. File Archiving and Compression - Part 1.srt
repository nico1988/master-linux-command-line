00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,150
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,310
And welcome to this field where you're going to start learning all about file archiving and compression.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,630
Now I'm sure you've heard millions of times about the benefits of keeping backups of your data and that's

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,170
exactly what we're going to be covering in the next few videos in the next few videos you're going to

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,310
learn how to archive and compress your files in the next to create backups.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,050
Now just creating the backups isn't good enough you're also going to learn how you can restore data

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,090
from those backups in the future.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,650
So when you need to uncompress it you day it will come back out perfectly by the end you basically going

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,840
to be able to create and restore your own backups to make sure you don't lose any important data.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,360
You're also going to learn about various compression algorithms so you can save the maximum amount of

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,560
space on your file system as possible.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,970
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,530
OK.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,320
So when you're compressing and archiving files in Linux the first thing you need to know about is something

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,060
called a tall ball.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,740
Now I want you to imagine that you're a shopping center or to your local store and you're buying some

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,640
apples.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,080
OK.

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,760
Now let me ask you a question.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,230
How would you make those apples after picking them up.

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,480
Easier to carry Well you put them in a bag right.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:13,140
And that's what creating a table is basically doing OK so creating a table is basically a way of putting

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,180
your files in a bag to make them easier to compress and make them easier to store.

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,520
OK and when you add files to a table you make it possible to store all of your files in one place.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,060
The table itself doesn't do any compression but tarballs can be compressed using compression algorithms.

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,620
OK so archiving files is basically a two step process.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,090
First you make a table and you make a table.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,550
And then secondly you compress the tarball using some kind of compression algorithm.

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,030
OK.

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,160
So let's go ahead and create their first Tabo.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,620
And so we're on our desktop now we can see that we've got file 1.60 Faltu that takes the 3.6.

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm going to put those inside a table.

33
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,000
Now if I do an ls on on these files and just have a look at them you can see that they're all about

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,080
10 kilobytes in size.

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,780
OK nine point eight kilobytes are about 10 kilobytes in size and we're going to put all of these into

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,920
a table.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,530
OK.

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,980
So to do so we're going to use the tar command the TJR command.

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,730
OK.

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,580
Now the command takes quite a few different options.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
In order for this to work.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
So first we type TA.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,420
Then we need to give it three options.

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,530
Says Type A dash and the first option is the C option.

45
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,130
Now the C option lets the common know that we want to create a new archive.

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,850
OK.

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,390
The next is vi which lets the to talk him I know that we want to do we wanted to speak to us.

48
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,920
We wanted to give us some feedback so we know how it's doing.

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,960
Nivea stands for Beauce and it basically says hey talk him and don't do this silently.

50
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,810
Talk to me and let me know what's up.

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,590
Like I said the v option is entirely optional.

52
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,950
You don't need it to make an archive.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
But you know it's good practice to keep it there.

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,330
OK.

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,990
And the final option is the f option.

56
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,610
Now the f option is so that it lets the talk about accept files.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,280
OK.

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,770
So no we need to tell the talkathon what we want to call our Tabo.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,310
OK.

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,440
Now by convention we enter all files with the TA file extension.

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,480
This is just a convention.

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,260
So we know what they are called later.

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,890
So let's call it archive dot tar.

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,800
Okay.

65
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,660
And finally what we need to do now is we need to tell the tar command what's going to go inside our

66
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,460
tarball.

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,060
OK.

68
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,370
So we want to a 1.60 Faltu not THC and fall 3 that takes t.

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,940
So she use a wild card to save some typing and put file 1 to 3 to 60.

70
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,410
OK.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,430
And with that we're ready to go.

72
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,590
So what we're saying is hey Torkham and we wanted to create a new archive.

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,750
So we give it the C option.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,060
We're saying Speak to us we know what's going on.

75
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,140
It's just the v option.

76
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,380
And we're going to give it the f option so that it can accept new files and create a new archive.

77
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,690
So let's just go ahead and press enter.

78
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,630
And we see that it told us what's going on and now we've got this new tar file that's actually being

79
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,000
created and you can see that it looks like a little box like a like you know a moving box.

80
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,030
So you know that it's that it's an archive.

81
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,090
And if we do analysis we can actually see that the tar ball file has actually been highlighted in red.

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,570
Just to make it stand a bit more which is quite nice.

83
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,020
So hooray we've actually managed to create our first tabel now that command this talk and I've had quite

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
a few different options in it.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
So what I've done is for all the commands dealing with archiving.

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,170
So in this video on the next video I've made a cheat sheet for you to download that details how to do

87
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,820
different archiving tasks.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,330
Don't worry about memorizing.

89
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,860
You can find not in the resources section for the next video.

90
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,610
When we finished dealing with archiving.

91
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,080
OK.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,480
So let's take a look at how large the file is by using ls with the l option and actually what we're

93
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,830
going to do is we look for the ones that have dot tar in them using using Gramp.

94
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,520
So we just see what has doctorand to focus our results a little bit and we see the actually it's about

95
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,280
40000 960 bytes.

96
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:17,070
Well that's strange because we had three about 10000 byte files and then we've got 40000 960 bytes for

97
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,480
the table.

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Shouldn't it be 30000 bytes or somewhere near there.

99
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,430
Well not exactly.

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,730
OK.

101
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,510
But think of the apple's example.

102
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,630
If each apple weighed 100 grams and you have three apples and then you put them in a bag with a whole

103
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,340
bag weigh 300 grams.

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,780
No because the bag has some weight as well right.

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,940
So what we're seeing here is just that in order to create a table we need to add some data.

106
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,510
So just think of the exercise being like the extra weight from a bag when you put apples in it.

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,540
It's just part of the convenience of building a tabo But don't worry when we compress the tar ball it

108
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,370
will be much much smaller than the falls would have been on their own.

109
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:54,950
OK.

110
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,720
Now we can tell that this is a tab all by looking the doc tor file extension.

111
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Right.

112
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,890
But remember that in Linux file extensions don't really mean anything.

113
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,080
They're usually just a convenience so that we can see as humans but they don't mean anything necessary

114
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,900
to the system.

115
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,330
So to double check that it is a tab all we can use the file commands that you learned about earlier

116
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,840
in the course.

117
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,410
If we do file I can click the screen file archive doc.

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,960
You'll see that it tells us that it is indeed up ta archive.

119
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,500
OK.

120
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,360
Now if we rename this table so we renamed it to be our archive.

121
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,680
Gosh BLAM.

122
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's say now if we do.

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,920
If we do the file command on that.

124
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,150
So file of our archived Autoblog.

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,290
You see that the system wasn't tricked and it still knows that it's a tar archive even though it didn't

126
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,200
have the tar file extension so let's change that back because we don't need any more confusion than

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,190
is necessary.

128
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,360
Best just to let you know that the top the doc file extension isn't particularly anything special to

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,250
the system.

130
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,080
But again it might be to other programs you have installed upon it but you can always check what the

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,190
true nature of something is using the file command.

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,050
OK but the doc file extension is just something that allows you and potentially other users to know

133
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,420
what type of file is at a glance.

134
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,770
Now you can actually take a look at what is in a tarball without having to extract it.

135
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,320
So let's say you downloaded this.

136
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,370
This archive.

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,050
From.

138
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,410
From the interweb.

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,910
And do you want to take a look at what's inside.

140
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,660
OK.

141
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,210
You can do that using the tar command and what you do is you give it to options like how you do the

142
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,220
t option and the f option and then you tell it aracari doctor.

143
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,330
OK so the T option means test label and it basically lets you check what's inside the file and the f

144
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,790
option it's just necessary in order to pass a file to the TOC command.

145
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,760
OK so when we do that it tells us that file 1 and 4 2 and 4 3 are inside the table.

146
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,380
That's pretty cool right now we're going to come into compression in a little bit.

147
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,730
But first take a look at how we can get these files outside of our tarball.

148
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,830
Again the cable is actually very simple.

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,670
First let's delete the file whatever Dotti XTi because they've all disappeared.

150
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,960
We've got just tabel here and we're going to extract the files out of that.

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,530
OK.

152
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,960
So let's try and do this now.

153
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,980
The way we'll do it is just it's actually very simple.

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,700
Right so you'll have to talk them and remember to create an archive.

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,920
You had CVF and then you read we wrote our archive doc Taung then we gave it some files OK now to extract.

156
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,710
It's very simple.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,970
OK instead of C for create you use x for extract and everything else is the same but you don't even

158
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:49,440
have to give any files because you're not putting any files into the archive you should stop tar X-Fi

159
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,000
extract VIF of for verbose so it tells us what it's actually doing and APH is necessary so you can pass

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,070
a file to the talk and when we press Enter we'll see that it has indeed extracted out for us.

161
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:07,640
For one Faltu and fall three from the archive and we have those back in that in the directory that we

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,230
that we were in when we ran the command.

163
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,790
So there we go pretty easy right.

164
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,120
And again all of this is in the cheat sheet for us.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,310
So now you might be thinking OK we've just extracted these files from the top from the table is the

166
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,610
table now empty.

167
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,860
Well actually it's not.

168
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,390
You can just.

169
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,500
You can actually check that the files are still in there by telling it just like you saw before checking

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,270
inside with the TANF options.

171
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,300
You can check the file one file to unfold three are still inside the table so no matter how many times

172
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,560
you extract from a table the table still contains what's inside of it.

173
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,710
So it's like an A it's a reusable bag that maybe you get from shops.

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,420
OK that's pretty awesome right now.

175
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm going to break the video here.

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,490
In interest of time and in the next video we're going to be talking about how we can compress our tar

177
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,830
balls to make them smaller.

178
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,780
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
