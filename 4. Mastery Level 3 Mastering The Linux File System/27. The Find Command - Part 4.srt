00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,460
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,380
And welcome back.

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,620
Now in this video we're going to be discussing one of the most powerful features of the find command

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,100
and to be honest of the command line in general a nice how you can once you've gotten your big list

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,010
of results from the find command how you can take those results and perform another command on each

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,520
of those.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,200
This is an incredibly powerful ability.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,080
So I hope you're very very very excited.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,890
So you can see here that I'm on the desktop using the PWT command.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,900
And we're going to make a directory called copy copy here.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,740
OK.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,670
Noticing that I'm having an underscore to represent the space that's good practice as I've mentioned

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,120
to you before to stop a command line messing up.

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,580
OK.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,220
So what we're going to do.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:53,190
OK let's say that we want to search the entire file system for every file that is bigger than 100 kilobytes

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,750
and less than 5 megabytes.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,950
So what I want you to do is I want is you just have a go at writing that command.

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:11,040
So how would you starting from the very base directory find every single file on the system and that

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,930
is greater than 100 megabytes and less than 5 megabytes.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,500
OK.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:27,320
So put that video now go have a go at it and then come back to see how you did.

23
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:27,820
How did you get on.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,720
Did you manage it.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,820
If you did I'm so proud of you.

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,090
That's like a technique that you're going to use so often when you work with the command line.

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,410
I'm really really proud that you've got that skill if you haven't.

28
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,320
Practice makes perfect don't where you get plenty of practice.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,170
As we as you go with your assignment later on.

30
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,520
But this is how I go about it.

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,310
OK.

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,650
I'd use the find command starting at the base directory.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,270
So we're going to press can type a slash.

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,140
We're going to specify that we want only files by using the type option.

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:02,200
We're going to say the size has to be greater than 100 kilobytes and the size has to be less than 5

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
megabytes.

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,810
Now because we're starting at the base directory here to make sure that our foreign command has the

38
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,770
ability to go into every folder we're going to prefix this entire command with a pseudo because otherwise

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,190
we get permission access errors and we don't want those.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,910
So let's just run the whole command as the administrator.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,680
OK.

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,080
So if we if we run that.

43
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,890
OK.

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,180
We're going to find a big list of results but I give in my password.

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,260
We'll find a massive list of results comes out OK.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
And by the way one of these things are running.

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,080
You can actually cancel it from running any come on the command line by holding the control key and

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
pressing C OK.

49
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,890
I'm not will that will stop the the command running.

50
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,520
OK.

51
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,780
And if you know it it's taking too long will you type something wrong and you realize it and you don't

52
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,520
have to wait until the thing finishes.

53
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,460
OK but we're getting a whole bunch of results.

54
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,470
Actually we can tell you how many there are.

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,370
When you see see by piping into the word count Come on you can see we got 3000 and 31 results.

56
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,650
That's quite a lot results.

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,140
OK.

58
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,970
Now let's say that we want to copy every single one of those files every single one of those 3000 and

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,160
it one results that matched I find Command's criteria to this copy here folder.

60
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,520
OK.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,360
How would we do that.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,750
Well the way that we would do that is using another option if I clear the screen using another option

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:36,340
for the find command called the exec option or the exact option stands for execute.

64
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,340
And I am I'm going to do it I actually going maximize the screen and so it has a bit easier to see.

65
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:47,220
So we're saying OK once you've done the search here on each result execute something.

66
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,820
Now here you just type the command as you normally would.

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:58,410
So we'd we'd say copy because we're going to use the CPE command to copy which is you know like we normally

68
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,960
would.

69
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,010
Now if you remember how the copy command works first what you do is you say what you want to copy and

70
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,240
then you say where.

71
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,920
OK.

72
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,890
So you say what you want to copy and then you say where.

73
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,170
Well we know where we want to copy it which is going to be on a desktop.

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,030
OK.

75
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,810
And it's going to be in the copy here folder.

76
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,480
So that's our path to the copy here for us rush home slashes the slash desktop slash copy here.

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,520
We can rather the other shorter by just putting the tilde there as well that would be fine.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,380
OK but what do we want to copy.

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,320
Well we want to copy every single one of those files.

80
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,800
The way to represent that is by using a pair of square squiggly brackets.

81
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,170
OK so you type some squiggly brackets.

82
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,010
And that what fills that space is every single one of those files.

83
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:58,230
Ok so in turn it will say copy whatever file one was to this directory then copy Faltu to this directory

84
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,940
and copy 4:03 to this directory.

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,130
So we've got all 3000 results now.

86
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,830
When you build out these these expressions you can have multiple of these.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,270
You know if you needed to in your command for whatever reason but once you have created it like we have

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,250
so we're saying OK find every file that's greater than a hundred kilobytes and less than 5 megabytes.

89
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,420
And once you find all those execute the copy command on it and copy it to our copy here directory on

90
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,700
our desktop.

91
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,460
And then when she finished all of that to end the command you don't just press enter.

92
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,390
You've got to tell it when you've finished your execute option and the way you do that is by pressing

93
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,960
a backslash and then a semi-colon.

94
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,480
OK.

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,990
So you see the backslash in the semi-colon and that is the command completely finished.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,490
OK.

97
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,620
So if you go ahead and run that's OK.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,890
And we wait just a little while until our show comes back what it is doing is it is copying and pasting

99
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,150
every single one of those options into our copy here folder.

100
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,710
OK.

101
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:13,940
So I guess if I stop that for now and then close this and go to the copyright holder there we go you'll

102
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:22,100
see that we actually have every single one of those files copied and pasted into our copy here directory

103
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,850
or at least as many as it did before I stopped running the commands.

104
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,410
It's awesome but we've managed to just use the find command and not only find what we want.

105
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,940
On the whole system but also execute a command on each of the results.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,190
So just as an aside depending upon what type of hardware that you're running bringing this command in

107
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,780
it's entirety might give your computer a bit of trouble.

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,740
So if you're finding that your virtual machine crashes just try and run the whole command to just a

109
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,950
maximum depth of four to save it you know finding every file on your files.

110
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,860
This should reduce it quite significantly the load on your computer anyway or try and maximum depth

111
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,120
of three.

112
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,810
I'm not sure that that should stop any problems if you find your virtual machine is crashing.

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,590
But first we don't want to do at the minute is just take a look at this command.

114
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,930
Isn't that awesome.

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,680
I mean considering that you haven't you maybe didn't know anything about the Linux command line just

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
a few videos ago.

117
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,340
Now you're looking at this command and you're probably thinking wow if I actually come that far and

118
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,630
this is the thing the links come on line isn't it at unbelievably complicated.

119
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,780
It's just a few concepts.

120
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,500
If they're explained to you badly or you don't quite understand what they mean it can be an absolute

121
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,380
nightmare.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,530
But once you understand them it's very easy to take you know just a few building blocks here and build

123
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,670
something incredibly powerful.

124
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,820
So here you are you found a way to search for every filing system in between 100 kilobytes and five

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,640
megabytes in size and copy them all to a specific folder in just a command.

126
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,700
And yet now you know how to do that so I think that's amazing and I really wanted to pause in this video

127
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,180
just to say I'm very very proud of you for making it this far.

128
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,520
And you're going to get many more congratulations on this in the conclusion section 4 for this section

129
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,370
of the course.

130
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,270
Now what I want to do is I want to move on just a little bit to talk about this exact option here.

131
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,530
This exact option is awesome as is to execute a command but it's not the safest of all things.

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:27,910
OK so if you can do if is instead of using the exact option you can actually type the OK option.

133
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,570
OK.

134
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,180
And what this will do is it'll do exactly the same.

135
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,630
It works exactly the same you don't have to change anything.

136
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,040
But instead of just doing the action directly.

137
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:44,990
If I if I try this it will noce ask me every time that it tries to copy something whether it's OK or

138
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,260
not.

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,160
If I type y it will continue and I type Y it'll continue for time.

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,460
No it won't.

141
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,020
And so on.

142
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,410
So I have a choice here about what it does for each file.

143
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,440
Now this would clearly be a massive pain if you have thousands of files but it's a good thing to bear

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,350
in mind if you are doing something for a few files and you're doing something destructive like deleting

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,180
or moving files instead of just copying like in this case and you want to make sure doubly sure that

146
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,860
nothing goes wrong you can use the OK option.

147
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,110
So then the exec option in order to do exactly the same stuff.

148
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,480
So the OK option is exactly the same as the execute option you don't have to change anything else from

149
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,360
it from here on just just bear in mind that you know it's it's it's a bit safer than using the exact

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,780
option but it's you know it's a massive pain if you've got thousands of files to do.

151
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,200
So as I was saying I'm really really proud of you for getting as far as you have in this section in

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,050
this video.

153
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,680
And by the way you can cancel your way out of the O.K. option by pressing control and see like you see

154
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,810
I've just done here.

155
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,110
And of course you can clear the screen by pressing control and Al.

156
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,750
But what I want to do in the next video is we're going to take this to the extreme.

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,830
OK we're going to really really show you how powerful the find command can be by doing a little finding

158
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,870
the needle in the haystack kind of activity in the next video we're going to create a folder called

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,110
haystack that contains 500 other folders and in each of those folders we're gonna make another 100 files.

160
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,060
This will be very easy.

161
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,020
Using our knowledge of our knowledge of brace expansion.

162
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,610
But inside one of those folders at random we're going to create a file called needle t XTi and then

163
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,940
we're going to use the find command to find the needle in the haystack and move it into our home directory.

164
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,550
OK so out of about 50000 possible files we're going to find that one and copy it exactly where we need

165
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,110
and it's going to be so easy to do you won't believe it.

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,720
OK.

167
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,010
We can do is we'll shift over into next video and I'll see you there to find the needle in the haystack.
