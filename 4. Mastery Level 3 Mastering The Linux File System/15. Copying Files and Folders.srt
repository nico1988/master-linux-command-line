00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,650
Hello you beautiful people are welcome to this video where you're going to learn how to copy and paste

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,150
files and folders using the command line.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,140
Now this should be a nice and quick lecture with just one command.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,560
The C.P. command which handles all the copying of files and folders in Linux.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,930
By the end of the video you'll know how to copy and paste files and folders using the command line and

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,980
you also see how to use the C-p command with wildcards to make copying and pasting even more awesome.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,200
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,040
OK.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,860
So here we are.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,010
And as you can see by the shell prompt I'm currently on the desktop and on the desktop I have a file

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,150
here called File 1.60 and if I opened it says hello there you beautiful people.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,530
I wonder how that got there.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:52,250
So let's say we wanted to copy that file to another file called file to Dr XTi.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,940
OK because I'm very very imaginative.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,490
So to copy it we use the c p command and the C-p being short for copy.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,990
Now we just need to tell the copy command.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,520
What we want to copy and where we want to copy it to.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,640
So what do we want to copy.

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,410
Well we want have to copy file 1.60.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,110
And remember I'm on the desktop already in the shower so I can just write for 1.60 if I was in the home

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,500
folder I would say copy desktop sosh for 1.60 just just so that you're aware.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,710
OK.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,300
So let's go to the desktop again.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,780
So we need to tell it what we want to copy and we want to copy it to.

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,730
So we want a copy for 1.60 and we want to copy to one or the file called Faltu tactics.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,670
So that's all we've got to type want to copy far one into another file called File 2.6 and when I do

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,760
that we'll see we get a file here called Faltu.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,210
And when I open up that also says hello there you beautiful people.

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,860
OK.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,310
So that's how you copy a file to another file which is pretty simple.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,530
So how would you copy a file to another folder to the directory.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,290
Well that's pretty simple too.

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,030
As I say the copy command all you've got to do is tell it what you want to copy and where you want to

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,060
copy it to.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,760
OK.

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,870
So let's say I want to copy fall one into this folder called Destination.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,270
OK.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,820
So I'll have to do is I copy file one.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,480
So far 1.60 and copy to destination.

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,360
And also let's say I also wanted to copy Faltu at the same time.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,240
OK so it's copy for one and file Faltu into the destination folder.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,140
OK so you can see here that the last thing that you put as a command line argument is the destination

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,710
and everything else that comes with for that is what you want to copy so I could have many many many

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,430
different commands.

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,540
And many many different files that I want to copy here but the last one is where I want to copy them

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,130
all to.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,800
Correct.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,800
So with that let's go ahead press enter and when I look inside destination we can see that we've got

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,360
four one on file two.

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,990
They have both been copied into that.

51
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,740
So as you can see this whole copying and pasting business is actually rather simple with the command

52
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,140
line.

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,190
And of course you can also do it with wild cards.

54
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,350
So I'm on the desktop at the minute.

55
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,890
Let's say I want to remove everything that starts with the Word file.

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,750
So if I do that both the text files should disappear because they both begin with the Word file.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,070
So if I do that are they both disappear.

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,620
Now I can copy and paste all the stuff from in the destination folder to the desktop but you're saying

59
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,820
copy destination.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,260
Slash everything.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,040
OK.

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,330
To this fold.

63
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,080
And how do I select this folder.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,540
Well if you remember back the there's always a hidden folder in each location and that refers to the

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,370
folder is if I just do and that is the full stops so if I just do that dot dot.

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,760
What that means is copy everything from within the destination folder into this folder which is the

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,050
desktop which is where we currently are the game.

68
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,200
So if I do that if I press enter.

69
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,560
You'll see the file one file to have been copied and pasted to this location which is represented by

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,470
the full stop here.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,740
And if you don't remember if I just do ls with the A option you can see here that we've got these two

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,900
hidden folders and the one with the one refers to this folder and the one with the doubled up refers

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,720
to the folder above it which is our home folder.

74
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:31,770
OK so I could for example copy everything from the destination folder to the parent folder of where

75
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,770
we currently are which is the home folders.

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:41,010
If I do that and I now look at our home folder we can see the file one file to have been created in

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,680
there.

78
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,070
So look wildcards work absolutely great with any command.

79
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,750
Even the copy command as well.

80
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,110
So let's clear the screen.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,580
We have seen how to copy and paste a file into another file.

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,760
We've seen how to copy and paste a file into a folder and we've seen how to copy paste files from folders

83
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,380
into other folders.

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,780
The only thing we need to know is how to copy and paste entire folders.

85
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,900
OK so we have here.

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,790
This copy the folder on the desktop and that's got three files in it.

87
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,280
It's got Faleh Fabi and falsie.

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,960
OK.

89
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,450
And we want to copy this entire folder into the destination folder so we don't just want the files we

90
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,970
want the folder as well so we don't just want the chocolate.

91
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,300
We also want the wrapper.

92
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,020
OK.

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,350
So the way that we can do this is by giving the C-p command the option which also stands for recursive.

94
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,450
Now if you remember from when we were deleting files and folders in the last few videos with the r.m

95
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,970
option recursive deleting meant delete that folder and everything inside it.

96
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,950
And it's very similar for the copy command.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,290
What we're saying is copy the folder and everything inside of it.

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,890
OK.

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,760
So to actually copy the copy of the folder into the destination folder we just typed out we say could

100
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,260
we say copy with the option then copy me into the destination folder and if I do that and then we look

101
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,350
inside the destination we will see that the copy me folder has been copied and pasted and all of the

102
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,570
different files are inside there as well.

103
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,880
All safe and sound.

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,730
So they have it.

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,040
You can now copy and paste files and folders using the command line.

106
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
It's quite easy right.

107
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,230
So as a very quick review you saw that the C-p command is what deals with copying and pasting of files

108
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,340
and folders in Linux and the way that it works is you have the C.P. you type c.p.

109
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,110
Then what you want to copy and you can have as many of those as you like.

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,330
And then in the end the last command line argument that you give it is your destination.

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,760
OK.

112
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,320
So you can have many things you want to copy but the final thing that you give it is the single destination

113
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,450
where you want all of those things to go.

114
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,540
Now if you want to copy entire folders so not just their contents but the actual wrapper the actual

115
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,970
folder itself.

116
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,300
Then you need to give the copy command the option to allow it to copy entire folders recursively.

117
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,990
And now with copying and pasting and way up next what we're going to be doing is we're going to be discussing

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
moving and renaming files and directories in Linux.

119
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,910
And what's really interesting is that you can actually use just one command to do both those things.

120
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,150
So to learn how to move and rename files using just one command I'll see you in the next video.
