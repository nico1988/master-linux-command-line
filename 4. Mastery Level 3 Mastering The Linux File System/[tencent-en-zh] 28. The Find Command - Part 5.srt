1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,120
大家好，美丽的人们，欢迎回来。
Hello you beautiful people and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,950
因此，让我们继续并使我们的工作与find命令完全极端。
So let's go ahead and make our work with the find command totally extreme.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,340
好的。
OK.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,980
因此，让我们继续在桌面上创建一个名为Hystack的文件夹。
So let's just go ahead and create a folder on our desktop called haystack.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,790
好的。
OK.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,990
所以这就是它出现的原因。
So there it is that appeared.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,470
我们在这里能做的就是制作500个文件夹。
And what we can do in here is we're going to make five hundred folders.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,250
现在我想看看你能不能记住怎么做，如果你能记住如何使用花括号扩展的话
Now I want to see if you can remember how to do this if you can remember how to use brace expansion

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,360
要创建500个称为文件夹的文件夹，您知道的，从一个文件夹一直到三个文件夹，直到
to create 500 folders that are called you know folder one folder to folder three all the way up until

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,150
文件夹。
folder.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,350
五百元。
Five hundred.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,750
所以现在就去上传一段视频吧。
So go ahead and post a video now.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,600
尝试使用大括号扩展使文件夹1到干草堆文件夹内的文件夹500，然后来
Try to use brace expansion to make folder one to folder 500 inside of the haystack folder and then come

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,730
回来看看你们进展如何
back to see how you got on

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,890
如果你能上车的话。
Had you get on.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,670
你成功了吗。
Did you manage it.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,170
如果有这么好的记忆力的话。
If so great memory.

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,160
如果没有，别担心。
If not don't worry.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,470
已经有一段时间了。
It's been awhile.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,610
让我们实际尝试一下，看看我们是否可以正确执行此操作，我们要做的是创建目录
Let's actually try and see if we can do this right where we're going to do is we want to make directory

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,510
干草堆劈开文件夹一点500。
haystack slash folder one dot dot 500.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,030
好的。
OK.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,600
这就是说，将文件夹1到500放在草垛文件夹内。
So this is saying make folder 1 to 500 inside the haystack folder.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,070
当我按Enter键，我们在干草堆中查找时，我们在那里有100个文件夹，我可能应该更换一下
When I press enter and we look in haystack we've got 100 folders in there and I probably should change

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,460
布局。
the layout.

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,130
我们走吧。
There we go.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,200
文件夹1 2文件夹500试图用鼠标结束，指向并单击它会让你
Folder one 2 folder 500 tried to end up with your mouse and pointing and clicking it will take you for

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,800
永远不会。
ever.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,610
所以我们走吧。
So there we go.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,850
我们现在已经做到了，在每个文件夹中，我们需要创建100个文件，500个文件夹中的100个文件。
We've done that now in each of those folders we need to make 100 files a hundred files in 500 folders.

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,400
没错。
That's right.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,230
而且这实际上一点也不难做到。
And it's actually not difficult to do at all.

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,530
挑战号码，看看您是否还记得如何将触摸命令与花括号展开一起使用
So Challenge number to see if you can remember how to use the touch command with brace expansion to

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:51,390
创建100个称为文件、一个文件到三个文件的文件，直到在每个文件中创建100个文件
create 100 files called file one file to file three all the way until file one hundred in each of the

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,130
五百个文件夹。
five hundred folders.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,210
好的，那就继续吧，试一试。
OK so go ahead and give that a go.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,220
然后回来看看你做得怎么样。
And then come back to see how you did.

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,610
好的，你怎么做到的。
All right how do you do that.

39
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,750
我更努力一点。
I was a bit harder.

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,860
希望你拿到了。
Hopefully you got it.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,030
如果没有，别担心。
If not don't worry.

42
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,890
这就是我做这件事的方式。
This is how I've gone about doing it.

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,430
好的。
OK.

44
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,590
所以我会使用touch命令，因为这是我们用来创建文件的。
So I'd use the touch command because that's what we use to create files.

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:21,150
我会说好的，在干草堆文件夹里，从1到500，我要你把文件变成1到100。
And I'd say OK in haystack folder in folder one to five hundred I want you to make file 1 to 100.

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,130
好的，如果我继续这样做，我们会看到的。
OK so if I go ahead and do that we shall see that.

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,990
在每个文件夹中，我们现在应该有100个文件，所以现在还有一个文件夹用于
Inside each of these folders now we should have 100 files so there be others folder one now has for

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,980
1到100。
1 to 100.

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,760
如果我选择另一个文件夹，则文件夹26代表1到100，以此类推，如果我们一直往下走到文件夹402
If I pick another one have folder 26 for one to 100 and so on if we go all the way down to folder 402

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,040
它有自己的100个文件。
that's got its own 100 files.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,590
所以你现在可以真正开始看到，当你有了所有这些不同的部件时，外壳是多么强大
So you can really start seeing now how powerful the shell is when you've got all these different pieces

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,770
你们可以一起使用。
that you can use together.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,280
好的。
OK.

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,190
现在我们所做的是在这100个文件中的每个文件中创建一个名为haystack 500个文件夹的文件夹。
Now what we've done is we've made a folder called haystack 500 folders in each of those 100 files.

55
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,870
好的。
OK.

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,320
如果我的数学没问题的话，大概有50000个文件。
So about 50000 files if my math is all right.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,170
所以现在我们要做的是，我要在这里输入一些东西，这是一个，不用担心
So now what we're going to do is I'm going to just type something here it's a it don't worry about how

58
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,740
它可以工作，但我将在此处键入一些代码，这些代码将在其中一个运行中创建
it works but I'm going to type a bit a bit of code here that's going to create in one of the run in

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,780
其中一个文件夹。
one of the folders.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,620
好的。
OK.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,570
从1到500的其中一个文件夹我们要做的是找到一个我们要访问的文件
One of the folders from one to 500 what we're going to do is we're going to find a file that we're going

62
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,830
制作一个名为Neidl Dr.XTi的文件。
to make a file called Neidl Dr. XTi.

63
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,530
好的。
OK.

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,980
这就是说触摸随机文件夹中的内容。
So what this is saying is touch inside a random folder.

65
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,280
它可以是文件夹1到500文件中的任意随机数，称为针60。
It can be folder 1 to 500 any random number in the file called needle that 60.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,660
所以我们已经创建了一个名为针的文件，它将t放入干草堆中的某个位置，但我们不知道它在哪里
So we've created a file called needle that takes t in somewhere in the haystack but we don't know where

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,540
现在我们的工作是使用find命令来找到它。
and it's our job now to use the find command in order to find it.

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,950
好的。
OK.

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,900
那么我们怎么才能找到针呢。
So how can we find the needle.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,610
让我们仔细考虑一下，清除屏幕并将其最大化。
Let's have a think through this clear the screen and maximize it.

71
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,410
所以，让我们来看看我们将如何做到这一点。
So let's just take a look how we might do this.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,510
所以首先我们可以使用find命令。
So first of all we can use the find command.

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,210
好的。
OK.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,420
我们要从哪里开始，从哪里开始。
And we're going to start where are we going to start.

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,430
我们可能从干草堆文件夹开始。
We probably start with the haystack folder.

76
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,310
好的，我们知道它就在大海捞针里，所以我们要从这一点开始搜索。
OK we know it's in the haystack so we're going to start searching from that point.

77
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,270
我们知道这是一份文件，对吧。
And we know that it's a file right.

78
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,150
因此，我们不需要查看所有目录，但请记住，默认情况下，find命令将
So we don't need to look at all the directories but remembering that the find command will by default

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,030
列出文件和目录。
list out files and directories.

80
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,210
所以我们需要担心在所有的搜索和返回文件夹中进行搜索，让我们
So we need to worry about searching through all the you know searching and returning folders let's just

81
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,500
查找文件。
look for files.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,830
我们知道它的名字是Nido Dottie axiUm Way。
And we know that its name is Nido Dottie axium way.

83
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,550
好的。
OK.

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,610
好的。
OK.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,660
所以，如果我们这样做，看看它是否有效，它是好的，它找到了可以进入内部的针头
So if we do that and Precentor and see if it works and it has OK it's found needle that takes the inside

86
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,080
文件夹。
folder.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,110
449。
Four hundred and forty nine.

88
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,700
太不对劲了，我们已经设法大海捞针了，但现在让我们试着把它搬开
How awesome is not right we've managed to find the needle in a haystack but now let's try and move it

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,100
到桌面上。
to the desktop.

90
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,670
好的。
OK.

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,630
现在我们已经得到了结果，要做到这一点，我们将使用确切的选项对其执行某些操作。
So to do that now that we've got the result we will use the exact option to execute something on it.

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,280
现在要搬东西了。
Now to move something.

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,050
请记住，您需要键入Move，而不是要移动的内容和要将其移动到的位置。
Remember you would type move than what you want to move and where you want to move it to.

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,230
记住，当然，我们必须以反斜杠、分号结尾。
And remember of course we've got to end everything with a backslash semi-colon.

95
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,970
这就是您和EXEC选项的方式。
This is how you and the exec option.

96
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,980
因此，我们要将某些内容移动到我们想要将其移动到桌面上的某个位置。
So we are going to move something to somewhere that we want to move it onto our desktop.

97
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,420
所以，就放一个倾斜的劈开桌面吧。
So just put a tilter slash desktop.

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,930
好的。
OK.

99
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,180
这就是我们的桌面。
So that is our desktop.

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
我们要把它搬到那里去。
That's where we're going to move it.

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,210
那我们要搬什么呢。
And what are we going to move.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,340
那份文件。
Well that file.

103
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,380
所以我们放了一组方形的弯曲括号，它对一个文件的作用与对100000个文件的作用相同。
So we put a square set of squiggly brackets and it works the same for one file as it would for 100000.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,040
所以，如果我们继续这样做，我们按回车键，祈祷吧。
So fingers crossed if we go ahead and do that we press enter.

105
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,300
现在，如果我关闭终端，在我们的桌面上看一看，我们实际上已经做到了，我们成功地做到了
And now if I just close the terminal and have a look on our desktop we've actually done it we've managed

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,410
要从可能有50000个文件堆积如山中的某个位置开始进行针式DirectX测试，请执行以下操作
to move needle directx t all the way from somewhere inside that haystack of potentially 50000 files

107
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,270
找到它并将其移动到我们的桌面上，这就是您过去学到的东西有多棒
find it and move it to move it to our desktop so that's just how awesome what you've learnt in the past

108
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,920
很少有视频可以做到这一点。
few videos can be.

109
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,000
因此，您在过去的几个视频中看到的是，find命令完全是一个野兽命令。
So what you've seen in the past few videos is that the find command is a total beast of a command.

110
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,110
你用它看到了太多太多的东西。
You've seen so many so very many things with it.

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
但主要的关键点，我只想做一个简短的总结。
But the main key point I'm just going to go through in a quick summary.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,070
好的，这样就可以使用FINE命令来执行复杂的搜索任务。
OK so the fine command can be used to execute sophisticated search tasks.

113
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,350
您还可以看到如何使用LOCATE命令，这对于快速使用非常有用
You also see how you've seen how to use the locate command and that's very good for just quick quick

114
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,430
就像你知道的搜索一样。
like you know searches.

115
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,660
但是，如果您想做一些非常复杂的事情，那么find命令是您想要使用的。
But if you want to do something very sophisticated find command is what you're going to want to use.

116
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,700
首先，它不使用数据库，而LOCATE命令的FINE命令直接工作
First of all it doesn't use a database whereas the locate commando's the fine command works directly

117
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,230
在您的文件系统上，这意味着它总是正确的，但是可能会稍微慢一些。
on your file system which means that it's always going to be correct but it might be slightly slower.

118
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,860
所以这只是一件需要牢记在心的事情。
So that's just something to bear in mind.

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,560
find命令允许您构建搜索查询，您可以在其中按文件名进行搜索
And the find command allows you to build up search queries where you can search by the name of the file

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,750
你要找的东西的类型、大小等等。
the type of the thing that you're searching for the size and so much more.

121
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,000
好的，您可以在手册页中看到这些示例，只需键入man，然后查找，您就可以阅读了
OK you can see examples of those in the man page just type man then find and you'll be able to read

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,440
Find命令的手册页。
the manual page for the find command.

123
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,060
它能做的事情实在太多了。
There's just so much that it can do.

124
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,160
好的。
OK.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,560
一旦获得了这个大的结果列表，您就可以使用exec选项来执行另一个命令
And once you've got this big list of results you can use the exec option to execute another command

126
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,250
这些结果中的每一个。
on each of those results.

127
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,720
只要记住以反斜杠结束，而不是分号。
Just remember to end that with the backslash than a semi-colon.

128
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,920
如果您正在处理少量文件，并且您正在做一些可能具有破坏性的事情
And if you're working with a small number of files and you're doing something potentially destructive

129
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:17,530
比如删除或移除或者类似的东西，或者移动文件，那么你就知道了，可以使用OK选项来代替。
like deleting or removing or something like that or moving files then you know use the OK option instead.

130
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,960
因为然后它会提示你说这个可以吗，或者这个可以吗，或者这个可以吗，你必须
Because then it will prompt you to say is this one OK or is this OK or is this OK and you've got to

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,130
每次都要授权。
authorize it every time.

132
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,830
因为这也是需要牢记的事情。
Because that's something to bear in mind as well.

133
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,170
现在，在您从过去几年中了解到Find命令之后，您可以
Now after what you've learned from the last few years about the find command everything else that you

134
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,400
在接下来的几个视频中可以学到的似乎真的是轻而易举的事。

OK so in the next video I'm going to be showing you how to open files on the command line and read what's

136
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,840
在他们体内。
inside them.

137
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,900
还开了很多小猫笑话。
And also be making plenty of kitten jokes.
