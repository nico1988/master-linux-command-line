00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello you beautiful people and in this video the time has come.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,500
Over the last few videos you've been learning about the structure of the Linux file system learning

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,730
how to navigate the file system using the command line you've been learning about file extensions in

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,940
Linux and how they differ from what you might find on other operating systems.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,860
And the last video you've learned about wildcards and how you can use them to turbocharge your workings

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,710
with the command line.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,400
But in this video you're going to take your first step from just looking at the Linux file system to

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,960
actually modifying it by learning how to create files and directories using the command line.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,160
And in this video you're going to learn how to use the touch and the M-K are commands to create files

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,370
and directories.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,960
And by the end of this video you're going to be able to create your own files and folders using the

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,700
command line.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,780
And then in the video after We're going to show you how to take what you learn here and turbocharge

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,170
it by combining it with wild cards you can create like a jillion files and folders in just one command.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,240
And that's not even an exaggeration.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,700
Let's go ahead and jump right into it.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,600
OK.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,640
So the first command we want to take a look at is something called the touch command or the touch command

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,650
can create new empty files.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,860
So let's say that I'm going to create a new file called file one on our desktop.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,730
So if I just head over to the desktop and I try to create a file called for one.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:29,190
All we have to do is type touch file one and we can see here that file one has been created and it's

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,700
appeared.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,210
OK.

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,160
That's pretty awesome.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,870
Now you don't have to do this in the directory that you're in.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,430
By the way.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,570
So for example if I did something like touch and then said I want to put that in the Documents folder

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,110
and make in the file called Distant file in the Documents folder.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,030
Now when I go ahead and take a look inside the inside the Documents folder we can see that Disston file

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,310
has been created.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,080
And remember that these files here all completely empty they just blank files when you use them when

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,370
you create them using the touch command.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,530
So that's pretty cool.

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,060
Right now the files that we create with the touch command are completely empty as I said but if you

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,160
want to create files that actually have some content in them that's where we can use the echo command

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,280
to redirect content into it.

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,770
So I'm on the desktop if I want to use the echo command to make a file called Hello directx T.

39
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm going to put the content to just the text Hello in there.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,440
Then I'll just type hello and redirect that into.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,300
Hello Don t XTi now redirection when you redirect to a file that isn't made yet.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,370
The shell will automatically create that file and put put what was going to go inside there.

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,840
Inside is if I go.

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,590
Echo Hello.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,980
And then redirect that Helder to XTi.

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,880
The shell will create the file and when we open it we'll see that halo is inside that far.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,130
So that's another way of creating files.

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,600
OK.

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,240
So that's how you use the touch command to create files that see how you might go around creating folders

50
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,360
making directories.

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,870
OK.

52
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,070
So the way you make directories in the shell if I just clear the screen is with the M-K the arc command

53
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,550
which stands for make directory.

54
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,490
OK so make Foldit and it works basically the same as the touch command.

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:19,050
So if we try to make a folder on our desktop called Folder then it will have to do is type M-K Diyar

56
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,470
and call it folder press enter and we see that a new folder called folder has appeared.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,410
All right.

58
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,070
Again this could happen at a distance it doesn't have to be in your current working directory.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:37,140
So if I wanted to make a folder in our pictures directory called Holiday OK and I press Enter then you

60
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,420
know I can check that in two ways I could proceed to go back to our home directory going to pictures

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,630
using CD.

62
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,820
And when we take a look we'll see that the holiday folders that we can have a look at our graphical

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,080
user interface as well.

64
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,900
We've got pictures and we've got a folder called holiday that exists right there as well.

65
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,660
Pretty cool right.

66
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,520
Now you can instead of creating folders one at a time you can actually create entire folder paths all

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,440
in one go.

68
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,290
So I'm back on the desktop and let's say I wanted to create this path.

69
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,460
I wanted to create blaw slash thing slash problem.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,890
OK but I can't go ahead and make that in one go because Micheles going to give us an error and it's

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,440
going to say that the folder doesn't exist.

72
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,990
This is because the shell tried to go to block the entire thing and then create Shambler them.

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,670
Now that's just the most ridiculous sentence in the course so far don't you think.

74
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,990
Anyway if we tried to give the M-K Diyar command the p option so we do.

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,670
M K D R P give it the p option.

76
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,820
It would then create the entire path.

77
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,170
Even though non of the folders exists.

78
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,000
So if we do block slash things slash blam it'd be like that and press ENTER we'll see that now we've

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,030
got blah.

80
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,300
And inside there we've got thing.

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,300
And inside that we've got a problem.

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,940
So that's really cool.

83
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,970
We made the entire path all in one go.

84
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,100
How awesome is that right now there's something to bear in mind when creating new files or directories.

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,270
And that is to try and avoid putting spaces in the name.

86
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,610
So for example if I create a folder called Happy Birthday file tape if I am KTAR happy birthday.

87
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,250
You see the what actually happened is we created two files to folders sorry.

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,750
Happy Birthday and that's because there was this space in between the text and that basically made it

89
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
to command line arguments.

90
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,970
OK we gave it one input which was happy and one input which was birthday but we wanted to be you just

91
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,110
one input.

92
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,150
Happy birthday.

93
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,050
Ok just one input so how do we do that.

94
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,660
Well actually the way you do that is you do MKR then surround it in quotes.

95
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,520
Happy birthday.

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,510
And when you do that you see we get one folder called Happy birthday but just in general having folders

97
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,630
with files with spaces in them is just a bit of a nightmare in Linux.

98
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,310
OK.

99
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,420
And because of this whole space issue in the command line arguments and all that stuff.

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,950
OK.

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:10,160
So usually what you want to do is instead of having spaces have underscores instead so instead of having

102
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,570
happy space birthday usually what you want to do is have underscores instead of underscores being this

103
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,200
little this little symbol here.

104
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,000
So here you can see that we have another folder but with an underscore instead of a space and that just

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,810
makes it work a lot nicer with table to completion.

106
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,930
OK and just lots of other flybys stops you messing up your command line arguments and things like that.

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,960
OK.

108
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,940
Another thing of course I think I've mentioned this multiple times but folders and file names are case

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,610
sensitive in Linux if I do.

110
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,210
And Cadia are happy underscore birthday.

111
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,820
That's a completely different folder to Happy Birthday in lowercase whereas on something like Windows

112
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,760
it actually wouldn't be the OK.

113
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:02,640
So that's a quick overview of how to create files and folders using the touch and Cadia are commands

114
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,610
in the next video is going to break in the next video we're going to take it up a notch and start combining

115
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,340
all this goodness with wild cards and a really powerful beti called brace expansion which is going to

116
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,560
allow us to create hundreds of files and folders all in one command.

117
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,650
So let's go ahead and put it right here and I'll see you in the next video.
