00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,210
大家好，美丽的人们，在这段视频中，我们将结束对地点的讨论
Hello you beautiful people so in this video we're going to be finishing off our discussion of the locate

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,940
命令，特别是您将学习如何使用update dbe命令更新数据库。
command and in particular you're going to learn how to update the database using the update d be command.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,490
在此过程中，您还将学习如何获得超级用户权限。
And you're also going to learn in the process how to gain super user privileges.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,630
因此，使用sudo命令可以获得管理员权限。
So administrator privileges using the sudo command.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,350
因此，这将是一场非常重要的讲座，不仅涉及到如何最大限度地利用
So this is going to be a very important lecture touching not only on how to make the most out of the

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,310
命令，但也为您提供了有关如何获得管理员权限的绝对信息
locate command but also giving you an absolute nugget of information on how to gain administrator privileges

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,630
这是一件非常有用的事情，能够在您的系统上做更多更高级别的事情。
which is such a useful thing to be able to do more higher level things on your system.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,680
因此，在本视频结束时，您将了解如何在LOCATE命令使用时更新数据库。
So by the end of this video you're going to know how to update the database at the locate command uses.

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,020
因此，LOCATE命令始终为您提供准确和正确的结果，并且您还知道如何运行管理员
So the locate command always gives you accurate and correct results and you also know how to run administrator

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,520
使用sudo的命令。
commands using sudo.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,270
所以这将是一场非常重要的讲座。
So this is going to be a very important lecture.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,270
让我们直接跳进去吧。
Let's go ahead and jump right into it.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,690
好的。
OK.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,190
因此，让我们开始学习update D-B命令，它是update database Hebel name right的缩写。
So let's start learning about the update D-B command which is short for update database Hebel name right.

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,410
那么让我们在我们的桌面上创建一个新文件，然后移到我们的桌面，然后我们将创建一个新文件
So let's create a new file on our desktops and move to our desktop and we're going to create a new file

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,510
叫来找我XTi博士，这样我们就可以使用触摸命令找我Pontiac的T。
called Find me Dr. XTi so we can use the touch command find me Pontiac's T.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,500
现在我们在桌面上有一个名为“查找活动”的文件。
And there we are we have a file called Finding activity on our desktop.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:25,540
现在，如果我尝试运行LOCATE命令，因为此Find Me文件是在我们的数据库之前创建的
Now if I try and run the locate command because this find me file has been created before our database

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,060
已更新，如果我尝试定位，则LOCATE命令将无法在数据库中找到它
has been updated and the locate command won't be able to find it in the database if I try and locate

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,200
在这里找不到我。
find me not here.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,510
我们看看是不是什么都拿不回来。
We'll see if we get absolutely nothing back.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,110
好的。
OK.

23
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,140
即使文件存在，但它还没有输入到数据库中，因此它的位置
Even though the file exists it's not been entered into the database yet and therefore it the location

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,900
通过搜索数据库找不到它。
can't find it by searching the database.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,440
好的。
OK.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,530
所以要更新数据库都要添加到数据库中，我们需要更新数据库。
So to update the database were added to the database we need to update the database.

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,770
这就是UPDATE D-B Come命令的用武之地。
And that's where the update D-B come command comes in.

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,770
因此，如果我们尝试，它会注意到我们实际上收到了一个错误，错误表明shell无法打开
So if we try it will notice that we actually get an error and the error says that the shell cannot open

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,530
实际的数据库文件。
the actual database file.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,840
原因是update D-B命令需要管理员权限才能运行
And the reason for that is the update D-B command requires administrator privileges in order to run

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,470
我们可以通过查看update D-B命令的手册页看到这一点，我们在
and we can see this by looking at the man page for the update D-B command and we see at the top of the

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,730
更新系统管理器部分中的D-B命令，该命令在手册的第8节中。
update D-B command that is in the system managers section it's in Section 8 of the manual.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,490
这意味着它需要提升权限才能运行，您可以在这里看到我刚才所说的内容
And that means it requires elevated privileges in order to run and you can see here what I was saying

34
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,150
关于每天运行的更新D-B。
about Update D-B being run daily.

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,360
因此，如果你愿意，你可以阅读更多关于这方面的内容。
So you can read more about that if you like.

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,030
但这里重要的是，它在手册的第8节中，因此需要管理员
But the important thing here is that it's in Section 8 of the manual and therefore requires administrator

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,580
权限，以便运行并参考CHIHI关于手册结构的信息。
privileges in order to run and refer back to the Chichi about the manual structure.

38
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,280
如果您需要一点提示，以及手册的各个部分都做了些什么。
If that if you need a bit of reminder of that and what the sections of the manual do.

39
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,790
好的。
OK.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,260
那么，我们如何才能获得管理权限才能运行此命令呢？
So how can we get the administrative privileges in order to run this command.

41
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:59,680
要做到这一点，您可以使用伪命令，我不确定它的发音是sudo还是su do，但发音是I吗？
Well to do that you use the pseudo command I'm not sure if it's pronounced sudo or su do but am I.

42
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,070
我喜欢寿司所以我们还是吃那个吧。
I like sudo so we'll stick with that.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,130
因此，sudo命令非常简单，您只需在想要以管理员身份运行的任何命令之前编写它即可。
So the sudo command is very simple you just write it before any command you want to run as the administrator.

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,890
所以我要输入更新辩论，仅此而已。
So I'm going to type update debate and that's it.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,630
好的。
OK.

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,740
现在，当我这样做时，因为我们正在尝试获取管理员权限，并且sudo命令
Now when I do that because we're trying to get administrator privileges and the sudo command is going

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,950
要求我们提供密码以输入我的密码，这是我通常用来登录的密码
to ask us for our password to enter my password which is the password I just use normally to log in

48
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,550
到下一台计算机。
to the next computer.

49
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,260
但是你知道，我们没有看到任何密码被输入。
But you know it's that we don't see any password being typed out.

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,420
这是一个内置在外壳中的安全功能，它阻止人们知道它的长度
Now this is a security feature that's built into the shell that stops people from knowing the length

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,660
您的密码。
of your passwords.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,030
原因是，如果人们知道你密码的长度，破解密码就容易得多。
And the reason is that if people know the length of your password it makes cracking it so much easier.

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,890
所以不要担心你看不到任何反馈。
So don't worry that you don't see any feedback.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,990
只需键入您的密码键入密码，当您按下该键时，外壳程序将接受该密码
Just type your password type the password is being accepted by the shell when you've done that press

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:55,250
输入，我们将看到shell在更新数据库时将暂停一段时间。
enter and we'll see that the shell will pause for a bit as it updates the database.

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,900
然后我们有一个shell提示符支持的广告，它让我们知道命令已经完成。
And then we have a shell prompt backed ad which lets us know that the command has completed.

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,880
现在我们已经更新了数据库，他们发现我的文件现在应该在数据库中了。
So now that we've updated our database they find me file should be in the database now.

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,300
那么让我们试着看看locate命令是否能找到它，让我们键入locate find me，找到那个文本。
So let's try and see if the locate command can find it let's type locate find me find me that text.

59
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,830
当我按Enter键时，您会看到，是的，这一次它确实找到了它，它告诉我们它在我们的桌面上
When I press Enter you'll see that yes it did find it this time it tells us it's on our desktop and

60
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,570
它叫“找到我，不是文本”，我们不一定要在桌面上。
it's called Find me not text and we don't have to be on the desktop.

61
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,120
我们可以在我们的Documents文件夹中，比方说，在我们的Documents文件夹中。
We could be in our let's say in our documents folder.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,740
我们可以按Primack和DIRECTORY。
We can press Primack and directory.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,180
我们在我们的文件中看到了这一点。
We see that in our documents.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,200
但如果我真的找到了，找到任何类似的东西，你说它会出现冰沙家的奇怪的斜杠
But if I do locate find me anything like that and you say it comes up with slush home slashes the odd

65
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:43,360
劈开桌面劈开找我点xti，这样它就能告诉我们实际文件在哪里。
slash desktop slash find me dot XTi So it tells us where the where the actual file is.

66
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,200
现在，如果我们再来看一下数据库文件，让我们先回到桌面一分钟
Now if we take a look at the database file as well let's just head back to our desktop for a minute

67
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,790
让我们看一下数据库文件，因此我们使用带有大写S选项的LOCATE。
and let's take a look at the database file so we use locate with a capital S option.

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:03,770
我们可以看到，如果我在Dr.XTi之后将其保存为数据库，实际上这是改变的。
We can see that actually this is changed if I save that as data base after Dr. XTi.

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,540
这就是我们之前的数据库和之后的数据库，如果我在我们看到之前打开一个数据库
So here we are we've got a database before and database after if I open up a database before we see

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,540
我们有1608个目录14853个文件
that we have what sixteen thousand eight directories one four thousand eight hundred fifty three files

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,890
还有其他什么都行。
and whatever else.

72
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,490
现在，如果我之后试着打开，我们可以看到我们以前有过这个。
Now if I try to open up afterwards we can see here that we've got this before.

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,740
44,853个文件之后。
Forty four thousand eight hundred fifty three files afterwards.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,410
少投了4,848票。
Under-vote four thousand eight hundred forty eight.

75
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:34,180
所以看起来有些文件实际上已经被删除了，或者来自系统7的某些文件具有哪七个
So it looks like some files have actually been deleted or something from the System 7 have what seven

76
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,720
2008年为5,000,000字节，之后为26字节。
million five in 2008 and 26 bytes afterwards.

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,960
是的，看起来好像自从我们上次更新数据库后，有些文件确实被删除了。
Yeah it actually looks as though since we last updated the database some files have indeed been deleted.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,840
所以可能有一些临时文件在运行或类似的东西，但您可以看到
So maybe there was some temporary files in operation or something like that but you can see that the

79
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,410
当您更新数据库时，它的大小确实会更改。
size of the database does change when you update it.

80
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,190
好的。
OK.

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,570
但是如果我再做一次，如果我在两点之后做数据库，然后看一看，应该是绝对没有区别的
But if I do that again if I do database after two and take a look there should be absolutely no difference

82
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
在这两个之间。
between these two.

83
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:11,330
这是两天后的基数，我在两天后查看数据库，会发现它们实际上是完全相同的
So this is day base after and I look at database after two and will see that they are actually exactly

84
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,910
一样的。
the same.

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,550
好的。
OK.

86
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:20,240
因此，当您更新数据库时，它现在确实会更改，因为update D-B命令需要管理员
So when you update the database it does indeed change now because the update D-B command needs administrator

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,700
权限或root权限才能运行。
privileges or root privileges in order to run.

88
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,520
您可以看到LOCATE命令的EXISTING和FOLLOW选项存在的原因，这样您就可以了解为什么会有这些选项
You can see why the existing and follow options exist for the locate command so you can see why these

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,120
它们已存在，并遵循它们，因此当您等待管理员更新
ones exist existing and follow them so that when you're waiting for your administrator to update the

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,990
数据库即使您知道没有管理员，您作为普通用户仍可以继续工作
database you as a regular user can still get on with your work even if you know you don't have administrator

91
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,710
特权。
privileges.

92
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,480
您可以在管理员可能正在收发电子邮件的同时继续您的工作
You could just get on with your work while the administrator is you know probably catching up on emails

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,110
或者是一些很聪明的东西，对吧。
or something pretty clever right.

94
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,200
在过去的几个视频中，您已经了解了很多关于定位命令的知识。
So you've learnt a lot about the locate command in the past few videos.

95
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,200
因此，让我们快速回顾一下您所学的内容，以确保您掌握了全部内容。
So let's just take a quick recap of what you've learned to make sure that you've got it all.

96
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,640
首先，定位命令搜索是存储在您的计算机上的前四个数据库
First of all the locate command search is a database that stored on your computer for the first four

97
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,790
与您给出的模式匹配的文件会返回一个结果列表，使用数据库是非常重要的
files matching the pattern that you give it returns a list of results and using a database is a very

98
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,610
快速搜索方法，但它需要更新数据库才能为您提供完整的
fast method of searching but it requires that the database be updated in order to give you a complete

99
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,740
和正确的结果列表。
and correct list of results.

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,730
现在，您可以使用的现有和跟随选项从定位来保护自己免受错误的影响
Now you can protect yourself against errors using the existing and follow options for the from the locate

101
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,170
指挥部。
command.

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,350
但这并不是最好的解决方案，最好的做法就是使用
But that's not really the best solution the best thing to do is just to update the database using the

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,180
更新数据库命令。
update DB command.

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,330
但这也是每天自动完成的。
But this is done automatically daily as well.

105
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,850
现在，要做到这一点，它确实需要管理权限或超级权限
Now in order to do that it does require administrative administrative privileges or privileges or super

106
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,760
用户特权，随便你怎么称呼它。
user privileges whatever you want to call it.

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,620
因此，您需要使用sudo命令sudo命令才能实际获得这些权限。
And therefore you need to use the sudo command the sudo command in order to actually gain those privileges.

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,030
输入您的密码，然后以管理员身份运行该命令。
Enter your password and then the command is ran as the administrator.

109
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,400
因此，为了更新库，您不需要只键入update debug，您可以键入sudo update dbi输入您
So in order to update that base you don't just type update debug you type sudo update DBI enter your

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,530
密码，则数据库已更新，然后您可以从该点开始使用LOCATE命令
password and then the database is up dated and then you can use the locate command from that point on

111
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,390
并且知道您的结果将是100%正确和最新的。
and know that your results will be 100 percent correct and up to date.

112
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,980
所以Lowkey是一个非常有用的命令，我一直在使用它。
So Lowkey is a fantastically useful command and I use it all the time.

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,790
