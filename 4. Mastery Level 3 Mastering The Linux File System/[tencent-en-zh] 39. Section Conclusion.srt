1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,490
恭喜您，您已经完成了本课程关于Linux文件的这一部分
So congratulations you've made it to the end of this section of the Course all about the Linux file

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,530
系统不能有效地导航Linux文件系统和处理文件很可能会导致
system not being able to effectively navigate the Linux file system and work with files is likely going

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,190
成为你会反复使用的技能。
to be skills that you will use over and over and over again.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,380
所以祝贺你走到这一步。
So congratulations for making it this far.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,920
所以。
So.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,030
因此，为了庆祝您到目前为止在本视频课程中取得的成功，请快速回顾一下我们所拥有的内容
So to celebrate your success so far in the course in this video have a quick review of what we have

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,070
在这一节中介绍，这样您就可以看到您已经走了多远。
covered in this section so you can see just how far that you have come.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,560
好的。
OK.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,530
所以我们首先讨论一下美国系统的文件结构，对不起。
So we first started off with a discussion of the structure of the file structure of the US system sorry.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,450
您可以看到，整个文件系统都有一个树状结构，从根目录开始
And you saw that the whole file system has a tree like structure starting with a root directory and

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,830
从那里向外延伸。
branching out from there.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,570
一旦您了解了文件系统的结构，并且有了可以使用的映射，您就会了解
And once you understood that the structure of the file system and had a map to work with you learned

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,450
如何使用pwd命令告诉您的shell当前在哪里运行，PWT将发出声音
how to tell where your shell is currently operating from using the P WD command that PWT sounds will

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,670
打印工作目录，它基本上会在屏幕上打印出您的shell当前所在的位置
print working directory and it basically prints out on your screen the location that your shell is currently

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,580
在这里操作。
operating in.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,670
您还会了解到，您可以通过浏览shell提示符来做同样的事情，该提示符的
And you also learn that you can do the same thing by glancing at your shell prompt which the bit of

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,130
在您输入命令的左侧终端中输入文本。
text in your terminal on the left where you enter your commands.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,640
好的。
OK.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,160
现在，一旦您了解了如何找出您所看到的位置，您就必须在文件系统中移动并更改
Now once you saw how to find out where you while you saw had to move around the file system and change

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,410
目录使用cd命令我必须通过使用cd命令列出目录的内容来查看
directories using the cd command I had to look around by listing the contents of directories using the

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,560
L%s命令。
L s command.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,710
现在，在学习了这些关键导航命令之后，您对文件的含义进行了讨论
Now after learning these critical navigation commands you had a discussion about the meaning of file

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,120
Linux中的扩展名，您可以看到文件扩展名在X中并不重要，但对于
extensions in Linux and you saw that file extensions don't matter much in X but might matter to the

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,550
在上面运行的程序。
programs running on it.

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,790
这意味着您可以灵活地为文件指定您想要的任何名称，但请记住
This means that you have the flexibility to give files whatever names that you want but remember that

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,600
您可能希望坚持标准的文件约定。
you might want to stick to standard file conventions.

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,110
如果您希望其他程序使用这些文件，那么您了解了
If you're expecting those files to be used by other programs then you learned about a feature of the

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,130
我相信你现在已经爱上的外壳是通配符。
shell that I'm sure you fell in love with by now which is wildcards.

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,660
现在，通配符允许您一次操作许多不同的文件，并且只需专门操作
Now wildcards allow you to operate on many different files at once and just operate on specifically

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,880
您要寻找的是什么，它可以为您节省大量时间和打字时间，而且它基本上会使您的
what you are looking for which is which saves you lots of time and typing and it basically makes your

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,760
指挥的力量要强大得多。
commands a whole lot more powerful.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,140
现在，一旦你记下了这些非常重要的基础知识，你就学会了一大堆命令。
Now once you had got those very important basics down you learned a whole bunch of commands.

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,890
我必须创建文件和目录，复制它们，粘贴它们，删除它们，重命名它们，移动它们。
I had to create files and directories copy them paste them delete them rename them move them around.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,480
此外，我还必须使用基于命令行的文本文件编辑器Nano对它们进行编辑。
And also I had to edit them with a command line based text file editor called Nano.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,400
但是，随着所有这些文件的创建、移动和编辑，很可能在某些时候您不会
But with all of this creation moving and editing of files it's quite likely that at some point you won't

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,370
确切地知道文件的创建位置或位置，您可能需要找到它。
know exactly where a file is created or located and you might need to find it.

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,300
因此，您可以使用LOCATE命令查找系统上的文件，并且可以让LOCATE命令使用
So you use the locate command to find files on your system and you'll have the locate command uses a

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,150
数据库来查找文件，并且您了解了如何使用update dbi命令来更新其数据库以确保安全性。
database to find files and you saw how to use the update DBI command to update its database for security

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,870
更新数据库需要普通用户没有的提升权限的原因。
reasons updating the database requies elevated privileges that normal users don't have.

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,660
那么，如何使用sudo命令临时成为root用户并执行您需要执行的操作呢？
So how do you use the sudo command to temporarily become the root user and do what you need to do.

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,340
您可以将其用于任何命令，而不仅仅是LOCATE命令。
And you can use that for any command not just the locate command.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,900
现在，虽然定位命令非常棒，但您可以快速完成工作。
Now although the locate command is awesome you can get the job done quickly.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,140
有时你需要一些更具定制化和重用性的东西。
Sometimes you need something a bit more customizable and heavy duty.

44
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,390
因此，在了解了LOCATE命令之后，您将了解如何使用find命令查找文件
So after learning about the locate command you learn how to find files using the find command that find

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,070
命令是一个功能非常强大的命令，它有很多选项可以确保您可以找到
command is a super powerful command that has loads of options to make sure that you can find what ever

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,900
你想在你的系统上。
you want on your system.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,800
它还有一个额外的好处，那就是一旦你发现了一堆董事的文件
There it also has the added bonus that once you have found a bunch of files of directors with the find

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,020
命令您实际上可以告诉find命令在该命令或每个命令的一系列命令下运行
command you can actually tell the find command to run under the command or series of commands for each

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,650
它找到的结果。
result that it finds.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,420
这使您可以很轻松地创建令人难以置信的强大功能。
And this allows you to create incredibly powerful functionality with very little effort.

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,760
然后，您将继续学习如何使用cat命令查看文件内部，这样您就可以
And then you moved on to learn about how to look inside files using the cat command so that you can

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,350
还可以使用cat命令将文件粘合在一起或连接不同的文件，有时您需要
also stick files together or concatenate different files using the cat command and sometimes you need

53
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,160
要反转数据，请执行以下操作。
to reverse data.

54
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,350
因此，您看到可以使用Attack命令垂直反转文件，也可以使用
So you saw that you can reverse files vertically using the attack command or horizontally using the

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,800
指挥部。
command.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,920
现在，有时当您打开文件或运行命令时，您会在屏幕上看到大量输出，并且
Now sometimes when you open files or run commands you get a whole lot of output on the screen and having

57
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,900
一下子出现在屏幕上是没有多大帮助的。
all on the screen at once is not very helpful.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,610
因此，您了解了最后一页，该程序允许您浏览大量文本以
So you learnt about the last page a program that allows you to page through large amounts of text to

59
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,380
让它更易于管理，你还学到了一大堆有用的策略，让你得到你想要的
make it more manageable and you also learned a whole host of useful tactics for getting just what you

60
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,540
想要从一个文件中。
want from a file.

61
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,280
head命令、ail命令和grep命令也是如此，然后您了解了如何对文件内容进行排序
So is the head command the tail command and grep command then you saw how you can sort of files content

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,620
以各种不同的方式。
in a variety of different ways.

63
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,320
最后，我们在讨论的最后介绍了文件归档和压缩。
And finally we topped off the discussion with a look at file archiving and compression.

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,810
你在这一节真的学到了很多东西，你应该为自己感到无比自豪
So you've really learned a lot of stuff in this section and you should be incredibly proud of yourself

65
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,640
太好了。
so well.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,700
9~10成熟。
Well done.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,420
现在你将使用你在这里一直学到的技能。
Now you will use the skills that you've learned here all the time.

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,810
我们都在做这方面的工作，现在它已经上线了。
We all work with that and it's come on line.

69
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,050
所以现在在您的Linux技能发展过程中，这真的是一个令人惊叹的时刻。
So it's a really amazing moment right now in your Linux skills development.

70
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,810
因此，在下一节中，您将了解如何在系统上计划和自动执行任务
So in the next section you're going to learn about how you can schedule and automate tasks on your system

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,600
使用bash脚本和一个名为Kramm的非常有用的实用程序。
using bash scripts and a super useful utility called Krumm.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
但在我们谈到那之前我有个项目要你完成。
But before we get to that I have a project for you to complete.

73
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,500
现在，该项目将挑战您如何使用Linux文件系统做各种事情，并使用一大堆
Now the project will challenge you to do various things with the Linux file system and use a whole bunch

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,960
并建立一条真正先进的管道。
of the commands and build a really advanced pipeline.

75
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,110
好的，现在它将会很棒，它将作为一种荣誉的徽章，因为你已经学到了所有的东西
OK now it's going to be awesome and it will serve as a badge of honor that you have learned everything

76
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,830
我们已经在课程的这一节中介绍了这些内容，这样您就可以放心地继续学习了。
that we've covered in this section of the course so you can feel confident moving on.

77
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,940
在下一个视频中，我将给你们一个项目简介。
So in the next video I'm going to be giving you a project brief.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,290
再次祝贺你们在这一节中所做的令人惊叹的工作。
So congratulations once again for what you've done in the section you're doing amazingly.
