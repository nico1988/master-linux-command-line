00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello you beautiful people so one really amazing thing about Linux is the way that pretty much everything

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,870
on the system can be treated as a file.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,360
And I saw this earlier when we did the totally awesome magic trick will be redirected data from one

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,460
terminal to the other and that was possible because the terminal was treated as a file by the Linux

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,960
operating system and can redirect data between devices on your system just like you can redirect data

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,430
between files.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,940
Now every one of the files on the system is on a structure known as the Linux file system tree.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,030
And in this video you're going to learn how the Linux file system is structured and you're also going

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,510
to get a tour of what some of the most important places on the file system are.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,770
By the end of the video you'll know the map of the land so to speak.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,030
And by knowing what you're actually navigating and how it's laid out you'll be much better prepared

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,210
to actually navigate it and modify it.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And that's what we'll start learning in the next video.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,650
So you're going to learn about some very important locations on your computer and also therefore which

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,380
will help you navigate even better loads of really awesome stuff in this video guys.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,870
So let's go ahead and get into it.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,880
The first thing you need to know is that the entire Linux file system follows a tree structure.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,000
So if there's no partitions on your hard drive every single thing on the system can be accessed in one

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,780
large tree structure.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,660
So let's go ahead and take a look at it.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,860
Here's an image of what the file system looks like.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,090
Now at the top of the tree we have what we call the root directory represented by the slash here.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,850
Now just to be clear in case you haven't come across the word before when I say the word directory I

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,700
basically just mean the word folder.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,540
OK so when I say a root directory I'm just referring to the root folder on the file system.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,880
The slash here now that folder is called the root directory because everything on the file system can

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,330
be traced back to that.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,980
Just like every branch and leaf on a tree can be traced back to the root of the tree.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,100
Now under that root directory there's a whole bunch of other directories these directories are said

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,540
to be subdirectories of the root directory.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,010
Another way to say that is that the root directory is the parent directory for all of these directories.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,200
In orange here now there may be more folders or directories present on your system but I've taken the

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,730
most important ones to show here in this image because a slide only has so much space.

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,390
Now each of these directories can have all the directories and files inside of them and the directories

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,040
inside those directories can have their own directories and files and so on and so on and so on.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,280
So the whole system does eventually look like a really big tree with hundreds and hundreds of branches.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,670
Now one of the most important directories on this tree is the home directory the home directory holds

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,230
individual directories for each of the different regular users on the system.

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,650
We can see that the system has three regular users.

40
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,420
We've got Alice Bob and Charlie and each of those users can have their own files.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,570
So for example if we take Bob we can see the Bob has folders in the home directory for their desktop

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,890
documents downloads music pictures and so on.

43
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,860
And each of those folders can have files and folders inside them Alice will have a similar structure

44
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,690
and so will Charlie.

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,010
You can access your home directory by clicking on this file's icon over here.

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,090
And what opens up by default will be your home directory.

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,330
Now everything that we've been doing in the course up until now so just playing with pipeline's redirection

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,520
and stuff and creating files they've all those files have all been in our home directory and you can

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,860
see that in our home directory We have a desktop documents downloads music pictures and so on and so

50
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,690
on just like Bob did in the diagram.

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,190
And if you are navigating around your file system you can always get back to your home directory by

52
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:43,860
clicking on this home icon here or by finding it in the path that appears at the top you can think of

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,950
everything on the file system as being in two major parts.

54
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,390
And this is a bit of an oversimplification but you can think of everything below the users home folder

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,580
as being specific to that user.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,140
And everything that's above the users home folder tending to affect the whole system.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,080
Now what good would it be if regular users could modify or even delete files that the whole system requires

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
to run.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,340
Not very good at all.

60
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,640
And that's why special files and folders that tend to affect the whole system usually require elevated

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,970
administrator or root privileges.

62
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,810
The root user on the system is similar to the administrator in windows on Linux.

63
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,620
The root user has absolute power over the entire system.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,250
Now I'll show you how you can perform actions of the root user in a later video.

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,260
But for now just be aware of their existence.

66
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,290
For now I just want to discuss what these folders at the top here do.

67
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,220
Now there's a lot of them.

68
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,460
So to save you from memorizing I've made a cheat sheet that you can download from the resources section

69
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,480
in this lecture.

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,570
Let's go ahead and go through it together now.

71
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,430
OK so as I said you can get a copy of this cheat sheet from the resources section in this video and

72
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,970
what it basically contains is a list of the different folders that are right underneath the root directory

73
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,760
written with a slash and a bit of a description about what they do so that you can have a bit more of

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,770
an understanding of what each of the folders does on your system.

75
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,170
Let's just do a quick whistle stop tour of each of them and then you can look at it later in more detail

76
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,840
for yourself.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,340
OK.

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,080
So we've got the slash directory to zoom in a little bit make it make the thing a bit bigger.

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,890
There we go.

80
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,230
So you've got the slash directory which is the very top or the root of the factory and this directory

81
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,950
holds everything else there is nothing higher up than the slash directory.

82
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,920
If you get here you are at the very top of the tree.

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,640
You've got the bin directory which stores common Linux user command binary b.n binary is where Ben gets

84
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,890
its name from for example the date command.

85
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,390
Come on now commands that are all stored in the binary is sex in the binary folder.

86
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:51,130
You've got the boot folder boot is for everything that is required to boot the system so bootable linux

87
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,370
kernel and boot loader configuration files over the dev folder.

88
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,330
So this is these are files representing devices.

89
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,870
Now there's many different files in that folder.

90
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,600
If the filename starts with T.T. why that's a terminal.

91
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,980
If it's also with F.D. that's a floppy disk.

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,860
If it's starts with SD or Haiti that's a hard disk.

93
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,110
If it starts with RAM then it's RAM and if it's also a CD then it's a CD-ROM.

94
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,250
You've got slash ATC which is administrative configuration files.

95
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,240
No ATC or ETSI as it's normally said is a very common folder.

96
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,100
You'll be using it a lot if you ever want to edit configuration files and how you edit those configuration

97
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,510
files is where Section 5 of the Linux manual comes into play.

98
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,910
Which is all about file formats and things like that so for editing many of the configuration files

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,380
are in the ETSI folder you'll be able to find a man page that'll show you how to do it.

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,130
Then you've got the home folder and the home folder is where the home directory is.

101
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,400
For regular users are stored so under the home folder you have a home directory for each of the different

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,820
users so for example I have one at slash home slash Ziyad.

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,960
I have my home folder inside the big home directory so if I had 3 other people on my computer called

104
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,770
Alice Bob and Charlie they'd be slash home slash and slash home slash Bob slash slash Charlie.

105
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,390
But in my case just slash slash Ziyad.

106
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,930
So that's where your home directory is stored in the home folder.

107
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,450
You've got slushed media which is where removable media such as us be stick's external hard drives and

108
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:22,210
things are mounted and anything that is removable from the system unlike hard drives like actual hard

109
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,440
drives.

110
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,010
Anything that's removable usually gets mounted on slash media slash lib is where shared libraries so

111
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,190
lib being short for libraries needed by applications in the slush business last Espen folders to boot

112
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,670
the system.

113
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,730
So this is where all that stuff is all loaded basically loads of installed stuff cause it's slash lib

114
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,590
slash.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,260
MT is a place to mount external devices you don't use it that often.

116
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,020
Usually slash media is used instead slash misc.

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,930
Being short for miscellaneous is a director we use to sometimes automate filesystems it's just there

118
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,290
just in case the system can use it.

119
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:05,550
Slash OPEC or Opt. is where you can store additional or in other words optional software.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,940
So anything that you install any programs that you install usually the files go in slash O.P. to slash

121
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,160
prok is about system resources as more administrative kind of stuff slash route.

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,830
Now this is the home folder for the root user.

123
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,560
So this is sometimes a point of confusion.

124
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,280
You've got the roof folder which is the slash sometimes called the slash directory and you've got slash

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,130
root and slash root is the home folder for the root user.

126
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,240
So it's a bit of a confusing terminology but just just bear in Bear that in mind.

127
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,840
OK the slash is the root directory.

128
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:50,650
It is the very top of the file tree and slash route is the home folder for the root user or the super

129
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,090
user or the administrator.

130
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,280
Similar city administrator if you are on Windows that's the home directory for the administrator almost

131
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,380
there now you've got slush Espen which contains administrative administrative commands or Beiner is

132
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,520
for the root or super user.

133
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,320
So Espen being super use a binary is OK so these are commands that can be run by the super user or the

134
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,210
root user.

135
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,830
You've got slashed VMP which contains temporary files run by applications sometimes when programs are

136
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,660
running they create temporary files to make them more efficient to run.

137
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,330
That's where those are stored.

138
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:31,210
The DMP folders usually cleared out very regularly or when the program's shut slushing us our last user

139
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,600
contains files pertaining to users that in theory don't change after installation and slash var contains

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,610
directories of variable data or data that changes a lot.

141
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,820
That can be used by various So for example system log files are usually found in here and log files

142
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,930
change a lot.

143
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,350
That's why they're in the slash or slash variable slash var being short for variable.

144
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,420
So they are these are the different folders.

145
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,700
The only at least the most common ones that are directly underneath the slash folder so have a look

146
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,170
at this Jiechi read through it once again and you know maybe with my video with my voice playing in

147
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,600
the background you don't have to memorize this.

148
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,310
The cheap seats there just in case you don't have to memorize this stuff you very quickly become familiar

149
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,350
with the most common ones that you'll use.

150
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,650
Most likely you'll just stick to using ETSI which is where configuration files are the home folder and

151
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,740
maybe media if you plug in a USP drive or something like that and maybe slash user if you want to and

152
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,190
it's something to do with programs.

153
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,110
But usually those are the most common ones you'll be you'll be dealing with but you'll become very familiar

154
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,420
at where files are.

155
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,880
We'll be using a lot of these different folders as we go through the course or don't worry if it all

156
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,040
seems like a bit we're right now that information is there forever.

157
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,790
Just take it take it one step at a time.

158
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,240
Don't be overwhelmed by it.

159
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,610
It's going to be fine and you'll very quickly become accustomed to it.

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
OK so there you have it.

161
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,880
You should now have a much better understanding of the Linux file system and how it's structured.

162
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,830
So as a quick recap we discussed that the Linux file system follows a tree like structure starting at

163
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,320
a base directory which is represented by the slash.

164
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,680
Now you lumber everything on the file system can be traced back to that base directory.

165
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,990
You also learned that there's a special user on HLN next system called the root user the root user is

166
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,820
similar to the administrator on Windows and the root user has absolute power over the entire system.

167
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,740
They can do anything that they want.

168
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,170
You learn that the home directory or the slash home directory holds individual home directories for

169
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,720
all the regular users on the system so that they have a place to store their personal files.

170
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,970
And you learn that the slash route folder is the home directory for the root user for the administrator.

171
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,530
You also have to look at a bunch of really important folders that are right underneath the base directory

172
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,530
and there's a cheat sheet that you can download in the resources section.

173
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,230
Well all that information is summarized for you.

174
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,060
OK.

175
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,360
Brilliant so that you understand the whole structure of the file system which is totally epic in its

176
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,050
own right.

177
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,700
I've also put a link to a series of blog posts in the resources section to learn more about the Linux

178
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,470
file system.

179
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,210
If you want to but for now we're going to go ahead and jump into using the command line to start navigating

180
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,480
the file system which is going to be really exciting.

181
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,550
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
