1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,940
All right scenary know how to make files and directories using the touch and M.K. DL commands.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,580
Let's take it up a notch and mess around a bit.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,190
So let's say that you're working on a big five year project and every month because the admin staff

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,840
hate you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,670
You need to write a 100 memo files to keep track of the project and the folder should be named something

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:29,160
like Jan. 2017 FEBE 2017 March 20th of March 2017 and so on and so on for five years and in each of

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:37,720
these folders there should be 100 files for 1 4 2 4 3 all the way until fall 100.

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,250
How can you create those files and folders up front.

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,960
Well doing it graphically would be horrific.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
There's actually just no way around it.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,830
There will be a whole lot of copying and pasting and a whole lot of renaming.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,760
And you're right click finger would be basically in agony by the end of the whole ordeal.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,570
But let me show you how easy it is to do on the come on line so to make this possible.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,290
We're going to use a powerful feature of the shell known as Brace expansion.

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,100
And this is totally awesome.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,930
Check this out.

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,740
So let's go ahead and open our terminal using our control or anti keyboard shortcut.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,330
And then what we're going to do is we're going to head over to the desktop using our cd command.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,910
I'm going to make a big folder called Project.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,580
And there we are.

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,600
It has appeared now in here.

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,730
This is this good change into it change into that product folder if we can see that now we're in the

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,220
Project for the on the desktop.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,550
And this is where the magic happens.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,050
OK.

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,070
We need to make 60 folders.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,490
Right.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,900
And they should all be in the format.

29
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:48,270
Jan 20:17 FEBE 2017 ma 2017 20:17 OK so three three letters then 2017 all the way up until December

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,220
2022.

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,600
So DEC 2022.

32
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,430
OK which is when the project evidence.

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,570
So what if I told you we could make all of those folders in one line.

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,570
This is all possible using the power of brace expansion.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,820
So here comes the command.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,420
And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to maximize the screen because it's kind of a big one.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,800
What we're going to do is win type M.K. DVR.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,310
OK.

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm going to open up a pair of braces and the braces are these squiggly brackets here and then we're

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,190
going to type without any spaces.

41
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,250
Jan comma FEBE comma March comma.

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:30,430
April May June July August September October November December without any spaces at all.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,690
OK I'm going to double underscore the moment Open.

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,740
Open up another pair of braces.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:48,110
OK then 2017 2018 2019 2020 two thousand twenty one and 2022.

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,770
So that's quite a long come on right.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,120
But what's happening here is something called brace expansion.

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,080
And here we have some braces so we've got one say here and another set here for the for the years and

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,360
the way that the shell is going to expand these braces is similar to how you would expand brackets in

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,390
algebra class.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,930
OK.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:17,970
So what happened first is you get January 2017 then February 2017 then March 2017 and so on and so on

53
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,280
until you get December 2017.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:29,310
OK then it'll just start all over again you get January 28 in February 2018 then March April May June

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,620
July all the way until you get December 2018.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,510
Okay.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,140
And so on and so on until you get all the way until December 2022.

58
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Okay.

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,260
So enough in suspense Let's go ahead and press enter.

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,050
Let's go ahead and run that now let's see if it works.

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,410
We're going to go into our project folder.

62
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,440
Oh oh my goodness.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,820
Look how amazing that is right.

64
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,840
So we've managed to create folders in that wonderful format there for every single one of the years

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,510
and if we highlight them it tells us that the 72 folders actually created.

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:16,080
So from January 2017 right here all the way until December 20 22 which is right there and everything

67
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,680
in between.

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,840
Isn't that awesome.

69
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,330
Just as an aside as well if I just maximize this here to say it was a bit of typing we could have actually

70
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,300
instead of typing out each of the dates because it's just numbers they're just numbers right that are

71
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,020
in a in a constant pattern.

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,600
We could have just done dot dot.

73
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,340
So 2017 to 2022 that's another aside right there.

74
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,070
Now imagine how long it would have taken to do that stuff using point and click method you imagine how

75
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,530
annoying that would have been.

76
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,700
Well we just did it in one command line a case so that we're sitting here feeling very smug that our

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,420
command line has just created like a jillion folders all in one go we've still got a little bit to do.

78
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,300
And that is we've got to create 100 files in each of these folders.

79
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,840
Now how are we going to do that.

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,200
Well actually it's quite easy we'll just use brace expansion again.

81
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,970
So we're going to do is we're going to open up our terminals again go onto the desktop go into the product

82
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,460
folder.

83
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,000
OK.

84
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,390
Now I'm here.

85
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,010
I'm actually gonna maximize the screen watch what.

86
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,830
Just watch what I do and then we'll see how it works.

87
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,520
OK.

88
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,920
So don't touch then I'm going to open up the Brace's.

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:35,490
John FEBE March April May June July August September October November December.

90
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,110
Underscore and our years 2017 2022.

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh by the way it doesn't just have to be numbers.

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,970
It could be a to Zed or a to Zed or something like B to F or something like that.

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,430
OK so anything is it that has a pattern like you know the alphabet or numbers you can use the dot dot

94
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,510
thing to make that happen.

95
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,790
OK but we're after 2017 till 2022.

96
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,450
OK.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:11,040
Now inside each of those folders we're not going to make a file called the source file and then has

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,150
one to wonder.

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,960
Ok so what is going on here.

100
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,040
This is Matt Ziyad Where where has this command come from.

101
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,500
Well basically what I'm saying is for each of these folders from January 2017 all the way until December

102
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,400
2022.

103
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,890
In each of those make file 1 to 100.

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,020
OK now this is just a bit of fun.

105
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,930
Ok so don't worry if it seems a bit like what.

106
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,330
It's just to show you how powerful the shell can be.

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,530
Let's take a look at it again.

108
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,660
Run that.

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,090
Let's close the terminal again.

110
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,140
Let's go ahead and take a look.

111
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's open up.

112
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
June 2022.

113
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,480
OK.

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,420
Because that's a good date.

115
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,330
So if we open up June 2022 we click that oh my goodness we've got file one to 100.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,670
OK maybe that was just a fluke What if we open up December 2020 and hope this fall one to 100 in there

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,360
as well.

118
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,400
What if we open up January I say April 2020.

119
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,830
There we go again we've got fall 1 to 100.

120
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,250
OK.

121
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:17,390
So isn't that awesome guys like you can see the way that we've just used brace expansion to make our

122
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,660
terminal command unbelievably powerful.

123
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,540
And if we've got 72 folders and I say well we're only going to do it for five years we ended up doing

124
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,320
it for six.

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,940
But if we have now got 72 folders with 100 files in each we just use one command line to create about

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,060
seven thousand two hundred files in one go.

127
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,820
I hope you can see just how powerful the shell is from from that little example right there.

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,590
OK.

129
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,870
And by the way brace expansion isn't only possible for the touch and Cadia are commands.

130
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,310
By the way it's actually usable across the whole shelf.

131
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,750
So for example let's take the ls command the ls command.

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,560
We can look in every single folder and get a list of what's in there.

133
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,180
So if I do.

134
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:14,160
John FEBE March April May June July August September October November December and then 2017 till 2022.

135
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,130
OK so I'm saying list out the contents of every single one of these folders basically and I press enter.

136
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:20,640
Oops.

137
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm in the wrong place.

138
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,380
So good desk top slash projects now press up key twice to get back there go again.

139
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,910
Well we can see the contents of every single one of the folders and you can see they all have 100 files

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,190
in it.

141
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,260
And we can see that we get the for 1 to 100 in every folder and it might look like the file ends in

142
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,540
fall 99.

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,710
But what's actually happening is if you look over here and see a file what it's doing is it's sorting

144
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,920
them alphabetically or sorting them numerically here so you see for one for 10 for 100 because they

145
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,650
all start with one right and then the nines end up over there.

146
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,310
But now we are getting as 1 to 100 in each.

147
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,560
And let's let's say that we wanted to take all of this output right this massive output and we just

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,470
got and redirect it redirect all the output into a file called out Dottie XTi.

149
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,670
And now when we when we take a look we've now got a file called out Dr. XTi.

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,600
And if when we take a look in there we can see that we've got all of that content in there.

151
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,450
April 2017 it tells us the files that that has and then it tells us what's in April 2018 and it tells

152
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,760
the following that this is all alphabetically sorted in there.

153
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,320
Isn't that awesome.

154
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:43,030
I'm just showing you here we have an epic file with the contents of 72 folders and in about 7200 files

155
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,210
in just one command line tell me that is an epic and would have took you for ever to do using point

156
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,200
methods now I appreciate this is really is this is really going to be a bit like whoa and that's OK.

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,470
All right.

158
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,510
I'm just showing you these basic skills.

159
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,970
Have these basic skills or just creating one file or creating one folder can easily be turbo charged

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,140
with very little effort.

161
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,750
As long as you understand a little bit about brace expansion of wildcards cards but I'll leave the imagination

162
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,640
as to why why you would do so up to you.

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
Because these skills can be applied to many different things and you know just just just to show a much

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,900
simpler case of brace expansion.

165
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:28,380
If we go to the desktop right here and say we just want instead of saying tourch file a text file be

166
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,910
Dottie XTi and file see tickety which will work fine.

167
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,910
We'll create three files brace expansion it makes that a bit easier by saying file you give it some

168
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,460
brackets.

169
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,260
A B C D C C because we're using the break the braces here.

170
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,020
Who's going to file a text file be that text.

171
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,410
Force-Iraq tasty presenter.

172
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,880
Now we are we've used brace expansion to expand that out.

173
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,320
OK.

174
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,570
So Bracey expansion comes into play all over the place.

175
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,980
And because here we are we've got some text which is a follows a very simple pattern we can use the

176
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,020
dot dot here and we're going to get the same result again we could we could maybe say OK I want file

177
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,380
F all the way to the.

178
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,610
We are going to get 4 v all the way to F on the desktop as well.

179
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,710
So here we are here f as V.

180
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,400
So to show you this brace expansion it's not particularly complicated thing.

181
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,740
Trust me there are useful things for what I'm showing you here but I just wanted to show you just how

182
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,640
powerful the shell can be with just a little bit of tweaking.

183
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,590
So that's sort of command line craziness for now let's just have a quick recap of what was actually

184
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,790
important from the last two videos.

185
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,280
So first of all you saw how to use the touch command to create new files and the use also so how to

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,070
use the mkdir command to create new directories which is my favorite way of saying the command.

187
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,760
By the way.

188
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,670
And you also saw that the mkdir command also has a powerful p option that can be used to create entire

189
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,620
folder paths.

190
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,680
So this is creating one folder inside of another folder inside of the folder.

191
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,820
All from scratch which is very very powerful stuff.

192
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,130
Use learn creating for files and folders in Linux is case sensitive and you learn that it's kind of

193
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,920
a bad idea to have spaces in your font aims so use underscores instead.

194
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,260
And finally we took file and folder creation to the next level by using brace expansion and embrace

195
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,970
expansion is kind of an advanced technique so don't worry if you didn't understand it.

196
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,520
It's not technically part of the course but you got to see it here anyway.

197
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,660
So lucky you.

198
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,740
But now that we've got a whole bunch of files and folders cluttering up our computer in the next video

199
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,800
you're going to learn how to remove them.

200
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,260
So to learn how to delete files and folders.

201
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll see you in the next video.
