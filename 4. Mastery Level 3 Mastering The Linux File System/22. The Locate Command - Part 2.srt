00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello you beautiful people so in this video we're going to be finishing off our discussion of the locate

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,940
command and in particular you're going to learn how to update the database using the update d be command.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,490
And you're also going to learn in the process how to gain super user privileges.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,630
So administrator privileges using the sudo command.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,350
So this is going to be a very important lecture touching not only on how to make the most out of the

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,310
locate command but also giving you an absolute nugget of information on how to gain administrator privileges

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,630
which is such a useful thing to be able to do more higher level things on your system.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,680
So by the end of this video you're going to know how to update the database at the locate command uses.

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,020
So the locate command always gives you accurate and correct results and you also know how to run administrator

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,520
commands using sudo.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,270
So this is going to be a very important lecture.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,270
Let's go ahead and jump right into it.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,690
OK.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,190
So let's start learning about the update D-B command which is short for update database Hebel name right.

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,410
So let's create a new file on our desktops and move to our desktop and we're going to create a new file

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,510
called Find me Dr. XTi so we can use the touch command find me Pontiac's T.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,500
And there we are we have a file called Finding activity on our desktop.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:25,540
Now if I try and run the locate command because this find me file has been created before our database

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,060
has been updated and the locate command won't be able to find it in the database if I try and locate

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,200
find me not here.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,510
We'll see if we get absolutely nothing back.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,110
OK.

23
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,140
Even though the file exists it's not been entered into the database yet and therefore it the location

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,900
can't find it by searching the database.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,440
OK.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,530
So to update the database were added to the database we need to update the database.

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,770
And that's where the update D-B come command comes in.

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,770
So if we try it will notice that we actually get an error and the error says that the shell cannot open

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,530
the actual database file.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,840
And the reason for that is the update D-B command requires administrator privileges in order to run

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,470
and we can see this by looking at the man page for the update D-B command and we see at the top of the

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,730
update D-B command that is in the system managers section it's in Section 8 of the manual.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,490
And that means it requires elevated privileges in order to run and you can see here what I was saying

34
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,150
about Update D-B being run daily.

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,360
So you can read more about that if you like.

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,030
But the important thing here is that it's in Section 8 of the manual and therefore requires administrator

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,580
privileges in order to run and refer back to the Chichi about the manual structure.

38
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,280
If that if you need a bit of reminder of that and what the sections of the manual do.

39
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,790
OK.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,260
So how can we get the administrative privileges in order to run this command.

41
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:59,680
Well to do that you use the pseudo command I'm not sure if it's pronounced sudo or su do but am I.

42
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,070
I like sudo so we'll stick with that.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,130
So the sudo command is very simple you just write it before any command you want to run as the administrator.

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,890
So I'm going to type update debate and that's it.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,630
OK.

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,740
Now when I do that because we're trying to get administrator privileges and the sudo command is going

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,950
to ask us for our password to enter my password which is the password I just use normally to log in

48
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,550
to the next computer.

49
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,260
But you know it's that we don't see any password being typed out.

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,420
Now this is a security feature that's built into the shell that stops people from knowing the length

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,660
of your passwords.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,030
And the reason is that if people know the length of your password it makes cracking it so much easier.

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,890
So don't worry that you don't see any feedback.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,990
Just type your password type the password is being accepted by the shell when you've done that press

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:55,250
enter and we'll see that the shell will pause for a bit as it updates the database.

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,900
And then we have a shell prompt backed ad which lets us know that the command has completed.

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,880
So now that we've updated our database they find me file should be in the database now.

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,300
So let's try and see if the locate command can find it let's type locate find me find me that text.

59
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,830
When I press Enter you'll see that yes it did find it this time it tells us it's on our desktop and

60
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,570
it's called Find me not text and we don't have to be on the desktop.

61
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,120
We could be in our let's say in our documents folder.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,740
We can press Primack and directory.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,180
We see that in our documents.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,200
But if I do locate find me anything like that and you say it comes up with slush home slashes the odd

65
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:43,360
slash desktop slash find me dot XTi So it tells us where the where the actual file is.

66
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,200
Now if we take a look at the database file as well let's just head back to our desktop for a minute

67
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,790
and let's take a look at the database file so we use locate with a capital S option.

68
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:03,770
We can see that actually this is changed if I save that as data base after Dr. XTi.

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,540
So here we are we've got a database before and database after if I open up a database before we see

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,540
that we have what sixteen thousand eight directories one four thousand eight hundred fifty three files

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,890
and whatever else.

72
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,490
Now if I try to open up afterwards we can see here that we've got this before.

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,740
Forty four thousand eight hundred fifty three files afterwards.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,410
Under-vote four thousand eight hundred forty eight.

75
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:34,180
So it looks like some files have actually been deleted or something from the System 7 have what seven

76
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,720
million five in 2008 and 26 bytes afterwards.

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,960
Yeah it actually looks as though since we last updated the database some files have indeed been deleted.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,840
So maybe there was some temporary files in operation or something like that but you can see that the

79
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,410
size of the database does change when you update it.

80
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,190
OK.

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,570
But if I do that again if I do database after two and take a look there should be absolutely no difference

82
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
between these two.

83
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:11,330
So this is day base after and I look at database after two and will see that they are actually exactly

84
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,910
the same.

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,550
OK.

86
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:20,240
So when you update the database it does indeed change now because the update D-B command needs administrator

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,700
privileges or root privileges in order to run.

88
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,520
You can see why the existing and follow options exist for the locate command so you can see why these

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,120
ones exist existing and follow them so that when you're waiting for your administrator to update the

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,990
database you as a regular user can still get on with your work even if you know you don't have administrator

91
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,710
privileges.

92
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,480
You could just get on with your work while the administrator is you know probably catching up on emails

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,110
or something pretty clever right.

94
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,200
So you've learnt a lot about the locate command in the past few videos.

95
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,200
So let's just take a quick recap of what you've learned to make sure that you've got it all.

96
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,640
First of all the locate command search is a database that stored on your computer for the first four

97
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,790
files matching the pattern that you give it returns a list of results and using a database is a very

98
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,610
fast method of searching but it requires that the database be updated in order to give you a complete

99
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,740
and correct list of results.

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,730
Now you can protect yourself against errors using the existing and follow options for the from the locate

101
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,170
command.

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,350
But that's not really the best solution the best thing to do is just to update the database using the

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,180
update DB command.

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,330
But this is done automatically daily as well.

105
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,850
Now in order to do that it does require administrative administrative privileges or privileges or super

106
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,760
user privileges whatever you want to call it.

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,620
And therefore you need to use the sudo command the sudo command in order to actually gain those privileges.

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,030
Enter your password and then the command is ran as the administrator.

109
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,400
So in order to update that base you don't just type update debug you type sudo update DBI enter your

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,530
password and then the database is up dated and then you can use the locate command from that point on

111
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,390
and know that your results will be 100 percent correct and up to date.

112
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,980
So Lowkey is a fantastically useful command and I use it all the time.

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,790
It's really quick to use but there's another command that doesn't require a database and it can actually

114
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,940
be way way more powerful.

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,520
It's called Find command and we'll be covering that in the next video.

116
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,750
So it's amazing.

117
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,390
It really really is cool you can do such powerful things with it in a calm way to show you.

118
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,510
So for all that good stuff.

119
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,210
I'll see you in the next video.
