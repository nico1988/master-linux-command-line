00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,830
Hello you beautiful people and welcome to this video where you're going to learn everything you need

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,380
to know all about moving and renaming files and directories using the command line.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,570
Now the interesting thing is both of these functions can be completed with just one command.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,200
So in this video you're going to learn how to use the envie command to move and rename files and folders.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,980
And by learning the one command we're going to cover in this video you're going to gain two very important

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,270
abilities for working with your file system.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,410
Talk about efficiency.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,010
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,280
OK.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,350
So let's first talk about renaming files now on the desktop.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:45,710
I have a file called old name Dotti XTi and I want to rename it to be called new name Datti XTi.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,840
Very imaginative.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,560
I know.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,930
Now to do this do this rename.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,790
It's really very simple to do using the M.V. command.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,240
So first we get to the desktop.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,770
OK so now I'm on the desktop where the files actually are.

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,320
And to rename all name to the new name.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:09,460
All I have to do is just do envy then old name Datti XTi which is the current name of the file and then

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,100
give it its nooning which is the new name Datti XTi.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,700
And when I press Enter you'll see that the file has been renamed.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,180
OK.

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,040
And we can see that using the LS commands.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,380
Well it's now a new name Dottie XTi simple and the same thing works for directories so I have a folder

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,020
here called old folder.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:36,370
And as we can see old folder actually contains a few files so it's got file one to fall 10 inside there.

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,930
OK.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,880
Now to rename.

29
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,380
Old folder to be called new folder and clear the screen.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:49,270
All you need to do is move old folder folder and when I press Enter we can see that the folder has been

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,570
renamed and it's just that simple.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,960
And even though we've just changed the name of the folder if we open it up all the files are still in

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,540
there exactly as they were before.

34
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,670
So renaming folders doesn't damage any of the contents inside.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,850
So with that said how can we move files from one folder into another folder.

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,660
This is also actually really simple.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,670
All we need to do is give the move command what we wanted to move and then the directory that we wanted

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,390
to move them to.

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,220
So this is very similar to the copy command with the copy command you gave it a list of all the things

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,140
you wanted to copy and then the final command line argument you gave it was where you wanted to move

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,820
it to copy it to sorry.

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,710
And it's the same idea with the move command.

43
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:41,020
OK so if we want to move everything from a new folder onto the desktop then all we have to do is say

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,800
move from new folder OK move new folder.

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,380
Everything in there to here which is the desktop.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,720
OK.

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,330
So the doctor Remember means the current working directory.

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,220
And this is you can see from the shell prompt that is the desktop.

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,890
So what we're saying is move everything from within new folder to the current working directory which

50
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,150
is the desktop option if I press enter.

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,320
You'll see that all of the files have been shifted onto onto the desktop which we can see using.

52
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,550
Alas we've got a one to 10.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,590
And if we look inside New Folder we can see that they haven't just been copied.

54
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,320
They have indeed been moved because the folder is completely empty.

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,690
OK so let's move all of these files back into a new folder.

56
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,980
So if I move everything that starts with file back into new folder that should take care of all that.

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,190
So there we go we've moved them all back into this new folder folder.

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,840
OK.

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,380
Now how can we move the whole of new folder just as Wonga.

60
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,640
How can we move this into our documents folder for example.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,110
Well that's really easy to do as well.

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,560
And it works just like you might expect.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,890
We just do move new folder and where's our destination when we want it to go into the documents folder

64
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,650
which is in our home directory.

65
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,870
So we put the tilter to say our home directory slash and then documents so the documents folder inside

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,590
our home directory we press enter and then when we look inside our home directory and go into our documents

67
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,990
folder there we are there's new folder sitting there all intact.

68
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:23,030
So now for the jackpot how can I move a new folder inside of documents or move it somewhere and rename

69
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,290
it at the same time.

70
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,800
So let's say I want to move it from our documents folder to the desktop and rename it to the jackpot

71
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,090
at the same time.

72
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,070
So how would we do that.

73
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,950
Well first we need to sell it we sell and move on what we want to move.

74
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,130
So let's say we want to move the new folder folder inside our documents folder.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,540
And this is something you should be comfortable with by the way using the tilter to represent your home

76
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,680
folder then documents then new folder.

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,210
OK.

78
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,660
The slash at the end is optional but I think it comes with the table to completion so we'll well we'll

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,220
leave it there.

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,890
OK.

81
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,970
Now where do we want to move it to.

82
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,170
We want to move it to our desktop so we could say the current working directory because as you can see

83
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,190
we're on the desktop.

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,990
So we're going to get the current working directory but we're going to call it jackpot.

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,470
So jackpot now because the jackpot folder doesn't exist.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,280
New Folder will become jackpot.

87
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,250
If I press Enter we'll see that jackpot has been created.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,950
Inside there are all the content or every single one of the files from new folder.

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,630
And if we go back into our documents we will see that new folder is no longer there.

90
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,680
So what happened.

91
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:43,820
We said move the new folder folder from within our documents folder and put it in this directory which

92
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,660
is the desktop.

93
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,070
But as as a folder called jackpot.

94
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,340
So that is how you can move a folder and rename it at the same time.

95
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,560
Pretty awesome stuff right.

96
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,310
So there you have it.

97
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,200
The M.V. command is a very simple but very effective command for anything that you'll ever need to do

98
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,230
with moving or renaming files.

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,110
And in this video you've seen how to move and rename files and directories using the ENVI command.

100
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,410
And this is how it works.

101
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:15,060
So if you want to move files and directories first you type the M.V. command then you give it command

102
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,990
line arguments.

103
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,130
Everything that you want to move and you can give it multiple of those and then the final command line

104
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,780
argument is the destination of where you want to move all of those things to.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,950
And if you want to rename files and directories we can only do one at a time but you give it what you

106
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:35,010
want to rename and then the new name and location if you want to move and rename at the same time and

107
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,120
you've seen how to do that in this video.

108
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,720
So just remember that if you have want to move or rename a file the NV command is what you need.

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,560
So in the last few videos you've learned how to modify the file tree quite a lot.

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,850
You can now create files and directories using the touch and and KTAR commands.

111
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,340
You can delete files and directories using the Ahriman or MDR commands you can copy files and directories

112
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,380
using the C.P. command and you can even move and rename files and directories using the command.

113
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,240
Well in the next video you're going to learn how to actually edit these files using the command line.

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,570
Now obviously this is going to be something that you'll do all the time.

115
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,770
So for all that good stuff I'll see you in the next video.
