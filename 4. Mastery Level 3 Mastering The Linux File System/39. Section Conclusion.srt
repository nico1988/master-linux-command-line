00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,490
So congratulations you've made it to the end of this section of the Course all about the Linux file

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,530
system not being able to effectively navigate the Linux file system and work with files is likely going

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,190
to be skills that you will use over and over and over again.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,380
So congratulations for making it this far.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,920
So.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,030
So to celebrate your success so far in the course in this video have a quick review of what we have

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,070
covered in this section so you can see just how far that you have come.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,560
OK.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,530
So we first started off with a discussion of the structure of the file structure of the US system sorry.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,450
And you saw that the whole file system has a tree like structure starting with a root directory and

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,830
branching out from there.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,570
And once you understood that the structure of the file system and had a map to work with you learned

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,450
how to tell where your shell is currently operating from using the P WD command that PWT sounds will

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,670
print working directory and it basically prints out on your screen the location that your shell is currently

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,580
operating in.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,670
And you also learn that you can do the same thing by glancing at your shell prompt which the bit of

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,130
text in your terminal on the left where you enter your commands.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,640
OK.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,160
Now once you saw how to find out where you while you saw had to move around the file system and change

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,410
directories using the cd command I had to look around by listing the contents of directories using the

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,560
L s command.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,710
Now after learning these critical navigation commands you had a discussion about the meaning of file

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,120
extensions in Linux and you saw that file extensions don't matter much in X but might matter to the

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,550
programs running on it.

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,790
This means that you have the flexibility to give files whatever names that you want but remember that

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,600
you might want to stick to standard file conventions.

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,110
If you're expecting those files to be used by other programs then you learned about a feature of the

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,130
shell that I'm sure you fell in love with by now which is wildcards.

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,660
Now wildcards allow you to operate on many different files at once and just operate on specifically

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,880
what you are looking for which is which saves you lots of time and typing and it basically makes your

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,760
commands a whole lot more powerful.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,140
Now once you had got those very important basics down you learned a whole bunch of commands.

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,890
I had to create files and directories copy them paste them delete them rename them move them around.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,480
And also I had to edit them with a command line based text file editor called Nano.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,400
But with all of this creation moving and editing of files it's quite likely that at some point you won't

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,370
know exactly where a file is created or located and you might need to find it.

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,300
So you use the locate command to find files on your system and you'll have the locate command uses a

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,150
database to find files and you saw how to use the update DBI command to update its database for security

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,870
reasons updating the database requies elevated privileges that normal users don't have.

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,660
So how do you use the sudo command to temporarily become the root user and do what you need to do.

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,340
And you can use that for any command not just the locate command.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,900
Now although the locate command is awesome you can get the job done quickly.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,140
Sometimes you need something a bit more customizable and heavy duty.

44
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,390
So after learning about the locate command you learn how to find files using the find command that find

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,070
command is a super powerful command that has loads of options to make sure that you can find what ever

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,900
you want on your system.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,800
There it also has the added bonus that once you have found a bunch of files of directors with the find

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,020
command you can actually tell the find command to run under the command or series of commands for each

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,650
result that it finds.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,420
And this allows you to create incredibly powerful functionality with very little effort.

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,760
And then you moved on to learn about how to look inside files using the cat command so that you can

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,350
also stick files together or concatenate different files using the cat command and sometimes you need

53
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,160
to reverse data.

54
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,350
So you saw that you can reverse files vertically using the attack command or horizontally using the

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,800
command.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,920
Now sometimes when you open files or run commands you get a whole lot of output on the screen and having

57
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,900
all on the screen at once is not very helpful.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,610
So you learnt about the last page a program that allows you to page through large amounts of text to

59
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,380
make it more manageable and you also learned a whole host of useful tactics for getting just what you

60
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,540
want from a file.

61
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,280
So is the head command the tail command and grep command then you saw how you can sort of files content

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,620
in a variety of different ways.

63
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,320
And finally we topped off the discussion with a look at file archiving and compression.

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,810
So you've really learned a lot of stuff in this section and you should be incredibly proud of yourself

65
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,640
so well.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,700
Well done.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,420
Now you will use the skills that you've learned here all the time.

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,810
We all work with that and it's come on line.

69
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,050
So it's a really amazing moment right now in your Linux skills development.

70
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,810
So in the next section you're going to learn about how you can schedule and automate tasks on your system

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,600
using bash scripts and a super useful utility called Krumm.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
But before we get to that I have a project for you to complete.

73
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,500
Now the project will challenge you to do various things with the Linux file system and use a whole bunch

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,960
of the commands and build a really advanced pipeline.

75
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,110
OK now it's going to be awesome and it will serve as a badge of honor that you have learned everything

76
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,830
that we've covered in this section of the course so you can feel confident moving on.

77
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,940
So in the next video I'm going to be giving you a project brief.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,290
So congratulations once again for what you've done in the section you're doing amazingly.

79
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,430
I'm super proud of you and I'll see you in the next video.
