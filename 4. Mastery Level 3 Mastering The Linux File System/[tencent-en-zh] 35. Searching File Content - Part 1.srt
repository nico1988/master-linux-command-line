1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,520
你好，你们这些漂亮的人知道你们什么时候在使用文件，什么时候在使用来自标准输出的数据
Hello you beautiful people know when you're using files or when you're using data from standard output

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,620
您很可能不想要所有数据，而是只想要其中的特定部分
it's very likely that you won't want all of the data but rather you just want a specific piece of it

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,780
你会想把所有的睡觉都切掉。
and you'll want to cut out all the rest.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,240
现在，我们在Linux中这样做的方法是使用一个称为grep命令的命令。
Now the way that we do that in Linux is using a command called the grep command.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,830
如果您曾经独自搜索过Linux，那么您可能只是在使用搜索引擎
And if you've ever searched about Linux on your own maybe just been you know using a search engine having

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,920
A环顾四周，你就会知道我已经遇到过这个团队，来吧，它是多么有用。
a look around you'll know that I've already come across the group come on just how useful it is.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
在接下来的几个视频中，我们将向您展示如何使用grep命令搜索
So in the next few videos we're going to be showing you how you can use the grep command to search through

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
文件和标准输出，这样您就可以过滤输出对您来说很重要的数据。
files and standard output so that you can filter out just the data that is important to you.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,580
在接下来的几个视频结束时，您将拥有一个非常强大的新工具，它将允许您
And by the end of the next few videos you're going have a very powerful new tool that will allow you

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,780
更快地做你想做的事，帮助你更快地在数据中找到东西。
to do what you want much faster help you find things in data much faster.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,920
我们会帮你去掉很多你不想要的东西，这样你就能得到
And we help you cut out a lot of the fluff that you don't want so that you can get the results that

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,400
你想要的。
you want.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
所以，让我们继续直截了当地谈吧。
So let's just go ahead and get right into it.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,260
好的。
OK.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,360
因此，作为快速提示，我想要讨论的第一件事是grep命令的实际作用。
So as a quick heads up the first thing I want to talk about is what the grep command actually does.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,610
好的，在我们开始讨论它的工作原理之前。
OK before we start discussing how it works.

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:05,040
因此，GRIP命令将搜索您提供的任何输入，以查找包含特定片段的线
So the grip command will search whatever input you give it for lines that contain a particular piece

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,130
您告诉它要搜索的文本。
of text that you tell it to search for.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,720
好的。
OK.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,920
例如，我在桌面上有一个名为Haloed Optics的文件。
So for example I have a file here called haloed optics on our desktop.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,770
如果我走到桌面上，使用cat命令来查看其中的内容。
And if I head over to the desktop and use the cat command to take a look at what's inside it.

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,520
令人惊讶的是，它说你好，还有漂亮的人，每个词都在自己的行上。
Surprise surprise it says hello there beautiful people with each word on its own line.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,150
现在，让我们使用grep命令查找其中包含字母e的所有行。
Now let's use the grep command to find all the lines in there that contain the letter e.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,720
好的，现在我们这样做的方式是，我们输入grep。
OK now the way that we do that is we would type grep.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,100
那我们要找的就是。
Then what we're searching for.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,110
所以字母A。
So the letter A.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,240
然后我们要看的是什么。
And then what we're looking in.

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,690
所以我们会说你好，点文本。
So we'd say hello dot text.

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,160
好的，我们现在要说的是，嘿，grep查找Hello dot文本中包含该字母的每一行
Ok so here what we're saying is hey grep find every line in Hello dot text that contains the letter

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,540
e，现在默认情况下，grep命令区分大小写。
E and now by default the grep command is case sensitive.

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,280
所以大写和小写都很重要。
So uppercase and lowercase do matter.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,850
好的，如果我按Enter键，您会在这里看到包含字母E和偶数的行
OK so if I press Enter you'll see here that we're seeing the lines that contain the letter E and even

33
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,300
信件本身也被强调了。
the letters themselves have also been highlighted.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,500
所以这很酷。
So that's pretty cool.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:15,240
有趣的是，在1939年，有一个叫欧内斯特·文森的人写了一本小说叫“盖茨比”。
Now interestingly in 1939 there was a person called Ernest Vinson right who wrote a novel called Gadsby

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
那大约有50000个字长。
that was about 50000 words long.

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,340
关于盖茨比的特别之处在于，尽管它有50000个字长。
Now the special thing about Gadsby was that even though it was 50000 words long.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,950
他用的字母一次也没有，这并不令人难以置信，特别是如果你考虑到字母E是
Not once was the letter he used it was not incredible especially if you consider that the letter E is

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,950
显然是英语字母表中最常用的字母。
apparently the most commonly used letter in the English alphabet.

40
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,680
所以，不使用字母写一本50000字的书，就像写故事一样，这真的是一项相当大的成就
So that's really quite an achievement to write a 50000 word book like a story without using the letter

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,510
一个。
A.

42
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,600
我只是碰巧，我不知道这是怎么发生的，这里有一份Gadsby的拷贝，这是随机创建的
And I just so happen I don't know how this happened to have a copy of Gadsby here in this randomly created

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,240
我们桌面上名为Gadsby的文件夹就在这里，所以我们需要Gadsby手稿Dotti XTi。
folder on our desktop called Gadsby right here so we want Gadsby manuscript Dotti XTi.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,780
现在这本书已经很旧了，它可以在公共领域免费获得，你可以访问
Now the book is so old now that it's freely available in the public domain and you can get access to

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,070
这与使用我将放入资源中的链接有关。
it to using the link that I'll put in the resources.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,720
现在不管怎样，这样做的原因是我们可以使用on来计算某个特定的行数
Now Anyway the reason for this is that we can use the come on to count the number of lines a certain

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,010
出现一段文本。
piece of text appears.

48
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,700
好的。
OK.

49
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,330
例如，当我们在Hello 0.60中搜索字母E时，我们会得到四个正确的结果。
So for example we see that when we search for the letter E in Hello 0.60 we get four results right.

50
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,850
所以我们跟那些漂亮的人打招呼。
So we get hello there beautiful people.

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,370
好的。
OK.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,600
所以我们实际上可以确认这一点，我们可以通过给予代表来C选项来查看一下，这将
So we can actually confirm this we can take a look by giving the rep come on the C option and this will

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,450
告诉你有多少行，它会给你找到的行数，它会告诉我们，我们
tell you how many lines it'll just give you the number of lines that it finds and it tells us that we

54
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,350
拿到四个。
get four.

55
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,990
好的。
OK.

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,010
所以它说，嘿，我在Hello T，S，T中找到了四行里面有字母E的行。
So it says hey I found four lines that had the letter E in them in Hello T S T.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,490
现在我们有了名为Gadsby手稿Dottie XTi的文本文件。
Now we have the text file called Gadsby manuscript Dottie XTi.

58
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,140
好的。
OK.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,760
如果我们打开它，你会看到这里有这么多东西。
And if we open it you can see that there is so much stuff in here.

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,140
好的。
OK.

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,800
这本书大约有43章长，超过50000字，实际上我可以告诉你是如何做到的
Is the fact the book is about 43 chapters long with over 50000 words and actually I can tell you how

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,940
通过进入Gadsby文件夹并在命令打开的情况下使用单词count，可以看到许多行
many lines is in there by going into the Gadsby folder and using the word count with the command on

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,090
盖茨比手稿告诉我们有1,914
the Gatsby manuscript and tells us that it tells us that there's one thousand nine hundred and fourteen

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,950
线条，这是相当多的线条。
lines which is quite a lot of lines.

65
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:21,840
好的，让我们试着在Gadsby一书中搜索Gadsby这个词，因为如果我在里面搜索GREP Gadsby
OK so let's try and search for the word Gadsby in the book Gadsby because if I do grep Gadsby inside

66
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,640
Gadsby手稿Dottie Xti你会注意到什么都没有出现。
Gadsby manuscript Dottie XTi you'll notice that nothing shows up.

67
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,770
没有显示的原因是因为Gadsby以大写G开头，而我们将其拼写为
And the reason that nothing shows up is because Gadsby starts with a capital G and we spelt it with

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,490
这里是小写的g。
a lowercase g here.

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,560
现在我们可以以不区分大小写的方式进行搜索。
Now we can search in a case insensitive manner.

70
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,520
因此，通过给组命令提供选项，大写和小写都无关紧要。
So the uppercase and lowercase don't matter at all by giving the group command the option.

71
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,430
好的，当我们这样做的时候，我们会看到它向我们展示了不同数量的结果，
OK so when we do that we'll see that it shown us it shown us a different amount of results here and

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,090
盖茨比在书中出现过好几次。
there's quite a few times that Gadsby has appeared in the book.

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,480
盖茨比的屏幕也一样清晰。
Gadsby has as clear the screen.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,310
您也可以在Goldsby书中搜索字母A，只需将字母A放在这里，我们将
You can also search for the letter A in the Goldsby book just by putting the letter A here and we'll

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,350
注意，我们在使用字母A的地方有一整串行。
see that we get a whole bunch of lines where the letter A is used.

76
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,010
好的。
OK.

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:13,190
如果需要，我们也可以通过按C选项进行计数，我们看到这951行包含
And we can count that as well if we want by pressing the C option and we see this 951 lines that contain

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,030
那封信。
the letter.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,240
所以这是相当多的。
So that's quite a lot.

80
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,490
现在我们来看看这本书用了多少次这个字母。
So now let's try and see how many times the book uses the letter.

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,590
好的，所以我们要做的是，我们不管它是大写的还是小写的，我们不需要任何e。
OK so that we do that is we don't care whether it's uppercase or lowercase we don't want any e's.

82
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,560
所以我们要让它不区分大小写。
So we're going to keep it case insensitive.

83
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,560
会不会算一下有多少条线。
And would it count how many lines there are.

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,220
我们要把后者放在那里。
And we're going to put there the latter.

85
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,720
如果我们现在继续按Enter，我们可以看到答案是零。
And if we go ahead now and press ENTER we can see that the answer is zero.

86
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,020
所以盖茨比的手稿没有使用字母E，这已经被Linux批准了
So the Gatsby manuscript doesn't use the letter E and this has been approved Linux approved that it

87
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,950
没有用到这封信。
doesn't use the letter.

88
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,620
因此，请下载参考资料部分的手稿，并亲自试用。
So download the manuscript in the resources section and try it out for yourself.

89
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,130
现在，您实际上还可以搜索完整的句子，只要您用引号将它们引起来。
Now you can actually also search for full sentences as long as you surround them in quotes.

90
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,910
书中有一句话说得很多，那就是我们的孩子们的台词，这样我们就可以在那里搜索
So one phrase that is quite a bit in the book is the is the line our boys so we could search in there

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,450
我们要用引号把它引起来，以确保它作为一个论点出现。
for boys and we're going to put that in quotes to make sure it goes in as one argument.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,230
当我们按Enter键时，您可以看到包含它的那九行，但我们也来看一下
And when we press ENTER you can see those nine lines that contain it but let's just take a look as well

93
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,970
来查看它们，这样你就可以看到文本有相当多的结果。
to see them so you can see there's quite a few results for the text.

94
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,210
啊，孩子们。
Ah boys.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,800
现在，您还可以搜索与特定文本不匹配的行。
Now you can also search for lines that don't match a specific piece of text.

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,870
好的。
OK.

97
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,160
这样，您就可以使用字数统计命令查看整个Gatsby文档中有多少行，如果
So you can see how many lines there are in the whole Gatsby document using the word count commands if

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:40,810
我现在做了一个1914行的破折号l Gad的B手稿，因为在Gadsby中没有字母E。
I do a word count dash l Gad's B manuscript in 1914 lines right now because there's no letter E in Gadsby.

99
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,200
应该有1914行不带字母H。
There should be 1914 lines without the letter H.

100
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,420
现在我们可以使用V选项进行检查。
Right now we can check that using the V option.

101
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,190
现在，v选项基本上执行相反的或反转搜索。
Now the v option basically does the opposite or invert the search.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,210
好的，如果我们用带v选项的egrep进行grep。
OK so if we do grep with egrep with the v option for.

103
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,980
E A K in Gadsby手稿Dotti x t.
E A K in Gadsby manuscript Dotti x t.

104
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,140
我们所做的就是我们在努力。
What we're doing is we are trying.

105
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,410
这将找出所有没有字母E的行。
This is going to find all the lines that don't have the letter E in them.

106
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,560
就像我说的，如果没有V，您将找到所有包含e的行，而使用V选项，您将找到所有包含e的行
Like I said without the V you will find all the lines that do have e in them and with the v option you'll

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,250
找出所有没有字母V的行，让我们这样做。
find all the lines that don't have the letter V in them so let's do that.

108
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,760
所以我们看到一大堆东西都出来了。
So we saw a whole bunch of stuff has come out.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,710
但是有多少人，有多少人真的出来了。
But how many of them how many of them have actually come out.

110
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,580
好的，我们可以用C选项来计算，我要上法庭了，我现在就把它剪掉。
Well we can count them using the C option and I'm going to court I'm going to cut it right now.

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,840
会不会是1914年的行会不会真的没有字母。
Will it be 1914 lines will Gadsby actually contain no letter.

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,700
哦，真是节省了时间啊。
Oh what a save on time.

113
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,040
请在下一个视频中回来了解。
Come back in the next video to find out.
