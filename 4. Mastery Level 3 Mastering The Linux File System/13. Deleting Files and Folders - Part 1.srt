00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,100
Hello you beautiful people I'm welcome to this video where we're going to be kickstarting our discussion

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,450
of how to delete files and directories using the command line.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,310
So in this video you're going to learn how to use the r.m command to delete files and you're also going

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,130
to learn how to use the r in command along with wildcards to make the room command even more powerful

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,690
by the end of this video you'll know how to delete files using the command line and then the next video

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,370
will move our discussion onto directories.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,400
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,950
All right so let's kick off by creating a file called Delete me in our home directory so we can see

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,620
that we're already in a home directory by looking at the shell prompt.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,760
We see the tilda the squiggle up there which means when the shell prompt but to confirm we could just

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,950
type the PDB the command print working directory and see that we are indeed in our home folder.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,020
So let's create a file called delete me.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,410
We're going to use the touch command and type delete me and press enter and then if we use the ls command

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,670
we'll see that we do indeed have a file called delete me and been created.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,800
We can confirm this of course by opening up our graphical file browser and we'll see a file called delete

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,090
me.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,740
Ok so so far so good.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,320
Clearing the screen.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,480
Now that we've created delete me how can we actually delete it.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,170
OK.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,900
Well the way to actually delete or remove that file is using something called the R M command.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,560
Now the r.m command is.

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,520
I will r.m stands for remove.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,970
And all you've got to do is give the r.m command a set of paths to files that you actually want to delete

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,470
and these could be absolute paths or relative paths.

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,890
So if we open up the man page for the r.m command it says that you can give it more than one file.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,770
Ok you see you can give it a file and then it's got three dots after it.

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:51,270
And we know from our discussion of command line syntax or command line layout that these three dots

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,460
mean you can have more than one.

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,380
And if you need a refresher on that check the cheat sheet in the previous section it's got all the information

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,330
there for you.

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,880
So let's go ahead and remove delete me so I could because I'm already in the same folder.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,560
I could just you know use the relative path like that.

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,720
R.m delete me.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,880
And when I press Enter we'll see that delete me has indeed been deleted.

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,070
I could if I create delete me if I create delete me in our documents folder this time.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,590
OK.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,850
So if I look in our documents folder we see delete me has been created at the minute in the command

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,180
line.

40
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,420
I'm just in the home folder.

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,270
So if I tried to do r.m delete me that won't work because there is no such thing as delete me in this

42
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,350
in this directory.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,410
So delete it.

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,320
I have to do all RAM documents.

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,230
Slash delete me so I have to give it the path relative to where we are now which is the home folder.

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,740
So here I am in Voda to get to delete me after documents then delete me.

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,050
OK so documents just delete me and I press enter and then it gets deleted.

48
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:53,680
OK.

49
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,880
And you can have more than one.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,320
So if I go ahead and create a file called let's say for one directx.

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,780
That's in our home directory.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,510
I create a file called Faltu in our documents so fall to take in our documents and a credit for called

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,750
for three dot tickety in our downloads.

54
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,550
Like I say I've got one in the home folder.

55
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,620
One of the documents and one in downloads.

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,590
OK so nearly all those I can just enter them one after another so I do r.m for one text.

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,710
I don't have to do anything because of that.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,730
That will do because I'm already in the home directory the same folder as it documents slash Faltu and

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,440
downloads slash file 3.

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:42,630
If I Precentor you see the file one disappeared Faltu has disappeared from documents and 4:03 has disappeared

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,470
from downloads.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,520
So DRM command is a very simple command to use for files.

63
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,810
Just think of it as the opposite of the touch command.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,380
If you want to create a file you do touch foreign one you want to delete it already.

65
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,680
R.m far one and it will work just like that.

66
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,280
So whether we've seen how to use the Aurum command in a basic way let's take it up a notch and use it

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,750
along with wildcards.

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,200
Now wildcards can really level up the power that your commands have.

69
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,240
So let's just see see how we do this using the R M command.

70
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,570
Let's make a few new files.

71
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:23,570
Let's make a file 1.60 spec Faltu dot PMG and 4:03 dot JP G.

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,470
So when I press enter you see that all three of those have been created in our home folder.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,820
OK now how would we delete every single one of them that ended in Datti XTi.

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,860
So that's actually just fanatic's make another one file for Datti XTi case.

75
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,790
We've got to the end in directx take and we've got one that ends in PNB and GBG.

76
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,090
How would we delete them.

77
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,060
They're the ones I ended up here.

78
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,850
Well first of all we could do it manually.

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,770
We could say our M-file won doctor 60 and for 40 actually that would work.

80
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,990
But I want a bit more of a clever solution than that.

81
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,130
I want to say delete every file that ends in Dot T x T.

82
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,340
Now the way we do that is by giving the command a pattern and anything that matches this pattern will

83
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,930
be added as a command line argument to it.

84
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,540
So if the pattern that I'm going to use is this star Datti XTi.

85
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,450
Now let's break this down.

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,890
OK so the star means anything.

87
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,030
Anything could go there.

88
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,430
So this whole thing is our pattern.

89
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,890
OK the start means anything and then Datti XTi.

90
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:37,280
So what this means is for anything to match that pattern at all it has to do is and in Datti XTi right.

91
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,880
So basically what this is saying is remove everything that ends in Dot XTi and we press enter on that.

92
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,660
You see the fall one and fall for have been deleted because they ended in Dot.

93
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,900
T x t.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:58,830
OK so let's let's try and see if we could make some other forces make this make file 1.60 again and

95
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,810
fall for the DOT T.

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,460
Let's make those back then.

97
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,080
Then let's let's create some of the files.

98
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:14,370
Is create some called Sublime Dotti x t and the circlets problem one right and then blam to.

99
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,680
PMG and sublime three top JPT.

100
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,690
So we've got some that start with problem and some that start with the Word file.

101
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,840
OK how would we delete the ones that just start with the word file.

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,030
Well the way that we do this is we would use the r in command.

103
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,550
Again of course because we need to delete then we need to give it another Potten.

104
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:45,000
So let's think how would we create a pattern that would match anything as long as it started with the

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,850
word file.

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,010
Well the way we can do that is we can take the word file and then put a star because this means as long

107
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,640
as it starts with file and then has anything after it it matches.

108
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,440
So all it has to do is start with the word file.

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,260
And if I press Enter we see the file 1 2 3 and 4 that text that you know doesn't matter about the file

110
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,010
extension or anything as long as they start with file they've been deleted.

111
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,140
But all of the Shebaa farms have been kept there.

112
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,800
OK.

113
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:19,330
So let's let's create 4 1 2 3 and 4 again so we're going to create touch for 1.60 Faltu dot PMG for

114
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,360
3.0 JPT and 4 for Dr. XTi we'll make them back again.

115
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,980
OK.

116
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,500
Now we want to delete all of the files that have the number two in them.

117
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,000
OK.

118
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,450
So how would we do that.

119
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,830
Well what we might do is we might say OK let's remove.

120
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,530
It doesn't matter what it starts with but it's got to have the two in there and it doesn't matter where

121
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,410
it ends in.

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,120
OK so here we are we're saying it could have anything then the number two and then anything afterwards.

123
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,500
Because if we do that we see the Faltu has been deleted and shoeblack 2 has been deleted but all the

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,930
others are OK.

125
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,810
What about getting rid of the ones that end in dot Jaypee.

126
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:12,610
Well to do that used to all RAM ends in Doc Jaypee I press enter for three JPT and sublime three have

127
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,720
been deleted.

128
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,940
All the others and the doctor he XTi are still there.

129
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,580
What about deleting those r.m everything that ends in Doctor XTi press enter.

130
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,750
And they've all been deleted as well.

131
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,570
So you can see here how wild cards can really make the the your commands a whole lot more powerful and

132
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,100
a lot more specific.

133
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,340
There's one more that I want to show you let's just go up here.

134
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:40,940
We've made back our files and let's make back ash blam problem files problem too doc PMG.

135
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,770
I think and sublime three top JPT.

136
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,570
OK.

137
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,920
Now what if we wanted to get rid of the ones that had two or three in them.

138
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,730
Well do you remember how we got to the one that had two in it.

139
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,340
Right.

140
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,390
We said it could start with anything then have to end in anything.

141
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,150
Well now we want to give it some options.

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,770
And this is where the square brackets come in.

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,690
So far he said.

144
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,900
OK.

145
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,050
Something like that but saying it could start with anything then have either two or three and then ending

146
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,060
anything.

147
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,480
So they should get rid of four two four three and sublime two and three.

148
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:24,530
So if hypocenter Faltu and fall three and problem two and three have been deleted.

149
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:30,640
So wild cards are incredible tools that really allow you to control what's going on when you use your

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,190
commands and anything that matches this pattern will be passed as a command line arguments to the command

151
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,790
that you use the wild cards for.

152
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,470
So that's a bit of wildcards in action as well.

153
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,260
So there you have it in this video you learn about the r.m command that the r.m command is the command

154
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,810
that's used to remove stuff from your file system.

155
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,590
And in this video we focus specifically on deleting files.

156
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,170
You also built upon what you learned in the last video about wildcards and saw wild cards being used

157
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,640
in action to delete files.

158
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,930
Now what you saw about wildcards in this video it doesn't only apply to the r.m command.

159
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,600
What you wrote about wildcards and how you might do specific tasks works for any command.

160
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,270
You build patterns called regular expressions with wildcards and whatever matches those patterns is

161
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,960
passed as a command line argument to the command that you're using.

162
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,020
So there you are you've seen some wild cards in practice as well.

163
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,200
Up next what we're going to be doing is we're going to be developing this discussion a bit more I'm

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,210
going to move on to looking at how you might delete directories.

165
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,680
How can you delete folders.

166
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,650
So that's a that's a completely next level it can be very smart and stuff.

167
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,480
So see you in the next video.
