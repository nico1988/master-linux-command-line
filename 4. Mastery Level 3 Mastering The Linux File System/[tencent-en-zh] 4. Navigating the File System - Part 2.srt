1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,590
Lovin，欢迎你们这些漂亮的人来看第二部分。
Lovin you beautiful people are welcome to part two.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,780
导航Linux文件系统。
Navigating the Linux file system.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,660
因此，在这段视频中，我们将在上一段视频中了解到的有关使用PWT的知识的基础上再接再厉
So in this video we're going to build upon what we learned in the last video about using the PWT and

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,910
LS命令。
the LS commands.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,910
但在本视频中，您将了解如何使用cd命令在文件系统中实际移动。
But in this video you're going to learn how to use the cd command to actually move around the file system.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,440
您将学习绝对路径和相对路径之间的区别。
You're going to learn the difference between absolute and relative paths.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,140
您可以了解一些非常棒的键盘快捷键，这些快捷键将使文件系统导航变得如此快速
You can learn some awesome keyboard shortcuts that will make navigating the file system so quick and

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,950
非常简单，基本上您将看到如何将pwt、ls和cd命令组合在一起，以
so easy and you basically going to see how you can put together the PWT the Ls and the CD commands to

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,510
优雅地导航文件系统。
elegantly navigate the file system.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,390
在本视频结束时，您将了解有关导航Linux所需了解的一切
By the end of this video you're going to know everything you need to know about navigating the Linux

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,220
使用命令行的文件系统，您稍加练习就会发现，您很快就会同意我的观点
file system using the command line and you watch with a bit of practice you'll soon agree with me that

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,250
这样做比使用点击式图形方法要快得多，效率也高得多
doing it this way is a lot faster and a lot more effective than using your pointy clicky graphical methods

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,360
你一直在用的东西。
that you've been using.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,540
到目前为止可能是你一生中的全部。
Probably all of your life so far.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,220
那么让我们直接跳到你的超级英雄训练的下一部分吧。
So let's go ahead and jump right into this next part of your superhero training.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,060
好的。
OK.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,530
在上一个视频中，我们看到可以使用P W D命令来查看我们在文件系统上的位置
So in the last video we saw that we could use the P W D command to see where we were on the file system

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,510
我们看到，我们可以将ls命令与各种不同的选项一起使用，基本上可以四处查看
and we saw that we could use the ls command with a variety of different options to basically look around

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,760
并列出进入时目录中的内容。
and list what was in the directory the way in.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,130
但是仅使用这两个命令，我们就有点停留在一个地方，如何才能真正移动
But using just these two commands we're kind of stuck in the one place right how can we actually move

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,070
从我们的主目录。
from our home directory.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,790
好的，缺少的部分是CD命令，而CD命令代表更改目录。
Well the missing piece is the C D command and the cd command stands for change directory.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,930
假设我们使用的是最后一个类型，我们注意到Downloads文件夹位于
So let's say that we used our last kind and we saw that the downloads folder by noting that it's in

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,280
蓝色，这是一个文件夹，我们想进入Downloads文件夹。
blue and it's a folder and we wanted to go into the downloads folder.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,260
我们怎么才能做到这一点。
How would we do that.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,960
我们可以用几种方式做到这一点。
What we could do it in a few ways.

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,010
首先，我们可以为cd命令提供我们想要到达的位置的绝对路径，从
Firstly we can give the cd command the absolute path for where we want to go with a go starting at the

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,810
基本目录，我们去劈开，然后回家，然后Ziyad下载，好的，我们可以像这样键入
base directory we'd go slash then home then Ziyad then downloads OK and we could type that in like that

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,020
这完全可以工作，或者如果我们不想将整个路径写入我们的主目录
and that would totally work or if we didn't want to have to write the entire path to our home directory

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,830
我们可以把这一切都换成蒂尔达。
we could just replace all that with the Tilda.

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:07,030
我们说OK，转到我们的主目录，然后下载，这就是您可以通过快捷方式使用波浪号的地方
We say OK go change to our home directory and then download that's where you'd use the tilde at a shortcut

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:15,330
或者我们可以使用的是所谓的相对路径号相对路径是相对于的路径
or what we could use is something known as a relative path number relative path is a path relative to

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,400
你现在的位置。
where you currently are.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,670
好的，因为我们当前在主文件夹中，如何才能到达Downloads文件夹。
OK so because we're currently in the home folder how do we get to the downloads folder.

35
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,420
好的，如果我们打开图形图形菜单，让我们想一想。
Well let's think about it if we open up the graphical graphical menu.

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,990
我们在这里，我们在主文件夹中，从这里开始。
Here we are we're in the home folder from here.

37
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,350
我们要怎么做才能进入Downloads文件夹。
What do we do to get to the downloads folder.

38
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,110
我们真正要做的就是点击正确的下载，这样你就可以说那是一个亲戚
We literally all we have to do is just click downloads right so that you can say that that's a relative

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,870
从这里到下载的路径，这就是我们要做的全部工作。
path which is going from here to the download that's all we've got to do.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,370
因此，要切换到Downloads文件夹，我们所要做的就是键入Downloads。
So to change to the downloads folder all we've got to do is type downloads.

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,870
如果我们这样做，如果我们只键入cd，然后像这样下载，然后按Enter键，您就可以看到
So if we do that if we just type CD and then downloads just like that and press ENTER you can see that

42
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,060
我们更改了目录，shell提示符也发生了更改，之前它只是Tilda告诉我们的
we have changed directory and a shell prompt has changed as well before it was just the tilda telling

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,430
我们在我们的主目录中。
us that we were in our home directory.

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,590
现在，它显示我们位于主目录和内部的Downloads文件夹中。
Now it's saying we're in our home directory and the downloads folder inside.

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,270
好的。
OK.

46
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,580
如果我们使用pwt命令，这里的蓝色文本显示了我们当前所在位置的路径
So this is this text in blue here shows us the path to where we currently on if we use the PWT command

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,950
现在我们可以看到，我们可以在劈开主页获得SLASY或劈开下载，我们还可以通过按下
now we can see that we get slash home slashy or slash downloads and we can also look around by pressing

48
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,050
ls命令，我们可以看到该文件夹中实际上什么都没有。
the ls command and we can see that there's actually nothing inside that folder.

49
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,410
好的，所以都不是，我们不是下载文件夹。
OK so neither We're not Downloads folder.

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,090
这是给你的一个挑战。
Here's a challenge for you.

51
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:37,080
继续发布视频，看看是否可以使用cd命令切换回我们的主目录。
Go ahead and post the video and see if you can use the CD command to change back to our home directory.

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,700
因此，请继续暂停视频，尝试一下，然后再回来看看您做得如何。
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot and then come back to see how you did.

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,810
你成功了吗。
Did you manage it.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,860
如果是这样的话真的真的做得很好。
If so really really well done.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,600
您现在学得非常快，您可以使用这样的绝对路径来完成它，您可以输入cd
You learn super quickly now you could have done it using an absolute path like this you could type CD

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,350
然后是劈开，主页劈开，你的用户名，或者其他任何东西，在我的例子中，它是兹亚德劈开。
then slash home slash your username or whatever would be in my case it Ziyad slash.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,340
就这样了。
And that's it.

58
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,620
好的，这样就可以了。
OK that would work.

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,510
或者你可以用一辆蒂尔达，让它变得又好又简单，只需用CD，然后用阿提拉。
Or you could have used a Tilda to make it nice and easy just use CD and then Attilla.

60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,040
现在我有点作弊，因为你可以用另一种方式来做这件事。
Now I kind of cheated a little bit because there's another way that you could have done it.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,710
从现在开始，这可能就是你做这件事的方式。
And this is the way you probably do it from now on.

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,510
但我以前没给你看过这个。
But I haven't shown you this before.

63
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,780
现在，默认情况下，如果您不给我任何输入，cd命令会将您带到您的主文件夹。
Now by default if you don't give me any input the CD command will take you to your home folder.

64
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,570
因此，如果我们只需从头开始输入cd，输入cd并按Enter键，您只需查看shell即可看到
So if we just type CD like from scratch type CD and press ENTER you can see by just looking at the shell

65
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,190
提示我们已返回主目录，我们可以使用Peter Beattie进行确认。
prompt that we've ended up back in our home directory we can use Peter Beattie to confirm that.

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,520
我的意思是，它告诉我们，我们回到了主目录，无论我之前在哪里，这都会起作用
I mean it tells us that we are back in our home directory and that will work no matter where I was previously

67
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,220
在文件系统上，我可能在文件系统的任何位置，所有的DO都是键入cd或按Enter键
on the file system I could have been anywhere on the file system all of the do is type CD or press Enter

68
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,230
然后我将返回主目录。
then I will end up back in the home directory.

69
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,140
很酷，对吧。
Pretty cool right.

70
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,030
好的很好。
Okay great.

71
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,340
现在我们回到主文件夹，我想向您展示ls命令的一个非常有用的选项。
So now we're back in the home folder I want to show you a very useful option for the ls command.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,900
这有点像戴着X光眼镜。
It's kind of like wearing X-ray glasses.

73
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,860
这是一个A选项，这个选项对所有人来说都是短的。
And it's the A option that the option is short for all.

74
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,760
它还允许您查看目录中的所有文件，甚至包括隐藏的文件。
And it allows you to see all of the files in a directory even the hidden files.

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,950
所以如果我输入ls并给它一个选项OK。
So if I type ls and give it the option OK.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,620
如果我按Enter键，您会注意到我们在这里看到了很多东西。
If I press Enter you'll notice that we see a whole lot of stuff in here.

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,250
把它打印出来。
Print it out.

78
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,240
好的，如果我清除顶部的屏幕，只显示最后一个选项，然后显示带有A选项的ls
OK if I clear the screen on top you just the last option and then show you the ls with the A option

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,740
你会看到我们用A选项得到了更多的东西。
you'll see we get a lot more stuff with the A option.

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,830
现在，您会注意到很多这样的文件都有以点开头的秋季名称，这意味着
Now a lot of these files you'll notice have fall names beginning with dots and that means that there

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,760
隐藏文件，甚至隐藏目录。
hidden files or even hidden directories.

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,300
好的。
OK.

83
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,690
现在，如果我们在图形编辑器中查看，默认情况下可能无法实际看到它们，但是如果我们
Now if we look in the graphical editor we may not be able to actually see them by default but if we

84
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,780
像我们在上几个视频中所做的那样，单击此处并显示隐藏文件，我们现在也可以看到它们
click up here like we do in the last few videos and show hidden files we can now see them as well so

85
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,630
您可以看到，我们得到的输出完全相同，这就是您显示隐藏文件的方式
you look you can see that we're getting exactly the same output so that's how you show hidden files

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,120
使用使用ls命令。
using the using the the the ls command.

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,580
好的。
OK.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,450
您可能还注意到，我们在这里有我们在几个视频之前制作的bash别名文件。
And you may also notice in here that we've got our bash alias's file that we made a few videos ago.

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,900
我之所以提到这一点，是因为每个文件夹中有两个非常重要的隐藏文件夹。
Now the reason I mention this is because these two very important hidden folders inside each folder.

90
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,850
它们是点文件夹和双点文件夹。
They are the dot and the double dot folders.

91
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,100
好的。
OK.

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,050
现在，这些快捷方式可以让您更轻松地移动或引用整个文件系统上的内容
Now these are shortcuts to allow you to move around easier or refer to stuff on your file system a whole

93
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,600
容易多了。
lot easier.

94
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,960
doc文件夹只是指当前目录。
The doc folder simply refers to the current directory.

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,430
好的。
OK.

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,430
例如，如果我转到Desktop文件夹，OK，我们就可以打印了。
So for example if I go to the Desktop folder OK then we can print.

97
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,500
很抱歉，如果我可以打印工作目录，我们可以看到我们在桌面上
My apologies if I can do print working directory and we can see that we have that we are in the desktop

98
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,050
如果我们的列表包含内容，那么我的桌面上应该不会有任何内容。
and if our list its contents this shouldn't really be anything on my desktop.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,270
但始终存在此数据文件夹和双点文件夹，它们仅在使用ls和选项时才可见
But there always is this data and double dot folders which are only visible using the ls with the option

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,260
正常地址的地址。
of just the normal address.

101
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,260
决斗选手DASH 8不会出现。
It doesn't show up for duellists dash 8.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,930
他们出现了。
They show up.

103
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,590
好的。
OK.

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,250
现在我们在这里有圆点和双点文件夹。
Now in here we've got the dot and the double dot folders.

105
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:57,190
如果我尝试对doc文件夹执行cd操作，Bash基本上会停留在shell将停留的位置
If I try to do cd to the doc folder Bash is basically going to stay where is the shell is going to stay

106
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,480
如果我这么做的话具体在哪里。
exactly where is if I do that.

107
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,080
您可以看到，我们仍然在桌面上查看shell提示符，因为DOT文件夹引用了
You can see that we're still in the desktop looking at the shell prompt because the DOT folder refers

108
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,690
到我们当前所在的文件夹。
to the current folder that we're in.

109
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,210
好的。
OK.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,600
这只是这个文件夹的一种说法。
It's just a way of saying this folder.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,480
好的。
OK.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,880
现在如果我去打双打怎么样？
Now what if I went to the doubleback.

113
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,230
如果我做CD翻倍怎么样？好的。
What if I do cd doubled up OK.

114
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,930
您注意到我们确实进行了更改，并且实际上回到了我们的主文件夹Double Up文件夹中
You noticed that we did actually change and were in fact back in our home folder the doubled up folder

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,610
指的是父文件夹或我们当前所在的上面的文件夹。
means the parent folder or the folder above where we currently are.

116
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,170
好的。
OK.

117
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,260
如果我回到桌面，你可以看到，如果我按下CD，我们就会有翻倍的东西，翻倍
So if I go back to the desktop you can see that we've got the doubled up for if I press CD double that

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
我们又回到了一个文件夹里。
we've gone back up a folder.

119
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,620
这会将我们带到主目录，以防我们回到主目录，让我们清除屏幕。
Which brings us into the home directory in case we're back in a home directory let's clear the screen.

120
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,240
如果我继续走下去。
What if I kept going.

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,830
好的，如果我看到点，我现在在实际的主文件夹中，它不是我的主文件夹，而是
OK if I go see the dot dot I'm now in the actual home folder which is not my home folder but it's the

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,170
位于我的主文件夹上方的文件夹。
folder above my home folder.

123
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,400
好的，我们继续走吧。
OK let's keep going.

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
请看圆点。
See the dot dot.

125
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,630
现在我们实际上只是在劈开中，我们在整个系统的基本目录中。
And now we're actually just in the slash for the we're in the base directory for the whole system.

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,180
好的。
OK.

127
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,280
看看还能不能再高一点，我们去C.D.点。
See if we can go any higher we go C.D dot dot.

128
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,510
你可以看到我们不能再往上走了，因为雪泥文件夹里的灰尘是
You can see that we can't go any higher because the dust the slush folder is the highest point on the

129
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,430
文件系统。
file system.

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,020
好的。
OK.

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,270
如果我做一个基本目录中的内容，我们可以看一下周围的情况。
And we can actually have a look around if I do an ls what's in the base directory.

132
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,670
看，这里有相当多的文件，当我们有一些文件的下一步信息时，你会看到这些文件
See there's quite a lot of files here that you saw when we had a little bit of next mation of the file

133
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:30,070
系统中有bin文件夹、boot文件夹、ETSI文件夹，其中包含您的配置
system you've got the bin folder the boot folder the folder the ETSI folder which is full of your configuration

134
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,730
文件。
files.

135
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,530
主文件夹，这是我们刚要去取我们的家居用品的地方。
The home folder which is where we just were to get our home stuff.

136
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,060
图书馆的媒体，也就是你拥有房间的地方，移走衣柜里的你可选的东西。
The library's media which is where you have your room remove wardrobe's your optional stuff.

137
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,030
路由用户主文件夹等。
The route users home folder and so on.

138
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:49,150
关于变量文件、临时文件、用户内容等等，我猜这些是文件夹和
So on the variable files temp files user stuff and so on and so on I guess these are the folders and

139
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,050
不管怎么说，其中最重要的是我给你的小抄，我们谈到的那些
the most important of these anyway are the ones that I gave you a cheat sheet where we talked about

140
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,670
文件系统。
the file system.

141
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,160
好的。
OK.

142
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,880
看看会发生什么。
And see what happens.

143
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,110
这是root用户的主文件夹。
This is the root user's home folder right.

144
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,650
这是管理员的主文件夹。
This is the home folder for the administrator.

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,450
让我们试着看看如果我们试图进入它会发生什么。
Let's try and see what happens if we try to enter it.

146
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,160
如果我们确实看到路线OK并按Enter，您可以看到我们得到的许可被拒绝。
If we do see the route OK and press enter you can see that we get permission denied.

147
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,340
好的，这里有一些你被允许进入的文件夹和一些你不被允许进入的文件夹。
OK so there's some folders that you were allowed into and some folders that you're not allowed into.

148
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,250
因此，我们没有足够的权限来访问root用户的主目录。
So we don't have enough privileges to be able to access the root user's home directory.

149
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,760
嗯，试试看ETSI文件夹和配置文件怎么样？
Well what about the ETSI folder OK along with the configuration files as try that.

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,670
如果我们试一试CD，看看我们怎样才能进入那张CD，让我们看看里面有什么。
If we try CD and see how we can get into that one let's see what's in there for us.

151
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,530
告诉我们你能看到里面所有的东西，对吧。
Ls us who you can see the whole bunch of stuff in there right.

152
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,030
你在这里放了一些文件夹。
And you get some folders in here.

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,040
蓝色的或文件夹和白色的文件，有些也有不同的类型。
The blue ones or folders and the white ones files and some of them have different types as well.

154
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,430
但你不必担心这一点。
But you don't have to worry about that.

155
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,430
大多数情况下，你会看到蓝色和白色，蓝色的文件夹，白色的文件，你可以输入任何东西
Mostly what you'll see are blue and white blue ones folders white one files and you can enter anything

156
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,060
你想要的东西。
that you want in there.

157
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,130
例如，这里有一个，我们在哪里找呢。
For example there's one here where are we looking.

158
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,270
这里有一个叫DHC Pay的，我们可以进入那个文件夹。
There's one here called DHC pay we could go into that folder.

159
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,710
我们可以试试CD DHC页面。
We could try CD DHC page.

160
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,720
好的。
OK.

161
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,060
现在看看里面有什么。
Now what's in there.

162
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,340
我们可以做l，我们可以四处看看，我们可以在那里看到其他的东西。
We could do ls and we can have a look around we can see this other stuff in there.

163
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,250
那边还有一个。
There's another one there.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,580
De D.H.爬了上去，并到了钩天。
De D.H. climbed and to hook day.

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,040
我们试着把DH客户的仪表盘和仪表盘挂钩。
Let's try to get the D.H. client dash and dash hooks.

166
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,410
你可以看到我们在那里，那里有两个L，我们在那里看到了其他的东西。
You can see that we're in there what's in there two Ls we see this other stuff in there.

167
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,020
这里的绿色是程序，但是您可以在这里看到我们在文件中移动的方式
The green ones here are programs but you can see here right the way that we are moving around the file

168
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,820
系统使用CD来移动LS来查看我们周围的情况，或者使用Peter Beattie来确认确切的位置
system using either CD to move LS to see what's around us or Peter Beattie to confirm exactly where

169
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,620
我们是。
we are.

170
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,420
就是这样，你实际上会在整个系统中移动，而且它不会改变
And it's this way that you will actually move around the entire system and it doesn't change no matter

171
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,560
您所在的位置只要您有权限输入这些文件夹，您只需使用以下命令即可进入这些文件夹
where you are as long as you've got the permissions to enter those folders you can get there using just

172
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,820
cd命令，您可以使用ls命令四处查看，并且可以确认您正在使用的位置
the cd command and you can look around using the ls command and you can confirm where you are using

173
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,260
PIDO EDI命令。
the Pido EDI command.

174
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,790
现在我们怎么才能一直回到我们的主文件夹。
Now how do we get all the way back to our home folder.

175
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,850
非常简单，只需按cd按Enter，我们就会回到主文件夹。
Very easy just press CD press enter and we are back in our home folder.

176
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,290
因此，您可以在Linux文件系统中的任何位置看到您需要做的几乎任何事情
So you can see the pretty much anything that you need to do in the Linux file system anywhere in the

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,710
只要您对CD拥有所需的权限，就可以移动到您想要移动到的扩展。
expansion that you want to move to as long as you have the required permissions on the CD.

178
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,750
LS和Peter真的很有号召力，你可以去任何你想去的地方，如果你迷路了，或者穿上了Pido的鞋子
LS And Peter really commands and you can get wherever you want and if you get lost or shoes the Pido

179
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,910
E-D命令检查你在哪里相当史诗吧。
E-D command to check where you are pretty epic right.

180
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,460
现在我们回到了主文件夹，我想教你们最后一件事。
So now that we're back in our home folder there's one final thing that I want to teach you.

181
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,940
这就是所谓的制表符补全。
And that's called tab completion.

182
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,190
但是看在上帝的份上，以及我们在过去几个视频中学到的所有东西的总结，我会再来看你的
But for goodness as well as a summary of everything we've learned in the past few videos I'll see you

183
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,600
在下一个视频中。
in the next video.
