00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello you beautiful people and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,950
So let's go ahead and make our work with the find command totally extreme.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,340
OK.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,980
So let's just go ahead and create a folder on our desktop called haystack.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,790
OK.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,990
So there it is that appeared.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,470
And what we can do in here is we're going to make five hundred folders.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,250
Now I want to see if you can remember how to do this if you can remember how to use brace expansion

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,360
to create 500 folders that are called you know folder one folder to folder three all the way up until

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,150
folder.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,350
Five hundred.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,750
So go ahead and post a video now.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,600
Try to use brace expansion to make folder one to folder 500 inside of the haystack folder and then come

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,730
back to see how you got on

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,890
Had you get on.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,670
Did you manage it.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,170
If so great memory.

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,160
If not don't worry.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,470
It's been awhile.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,610
Let's actually try and see if we can do this right where we're going to do is we want to make directory

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,510
haystack slash folder one dot dot 500.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,030
OK.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,600
So this is saying make folder 1 to 500 inside the haystack folder.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,070
When I press enter and we look in haystack we've got 100 folders in there and I probably should change

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,460
the layout.

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,130
There we go.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,200
Folder one 2 folder 500 tried to end up with your mouse and pointing and clicking it will take you for

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,800
ever.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,610
So there we go.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,850
We've done that now in each of those folders we need to make 100 files a hundred files in 500 folders.

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,400
That's right.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,230
And it's actually not difficult to do at all.

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,530
So Challenge number to see if you can remember how to use the touch command with brace expansion to

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:51,390
create 100 files called file one file to file three all the way until file one hundred in each of the

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,130
five hundred folders.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,210
OK so go ahead and give that a go.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,220
And then come back to see how you did.

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,610
All right how do you do that.

39
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,750
I was a bit harder.

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,860
Hopefully you got it.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,030
If not don't worry.

42
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,890
This is how I've gone about doing it.

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,430
OK.

44
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,590
So I'd use the touch command because that's what we use to create files.

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:21,150
And I'd say OK in haystack folder in folder one to five hundred I want you to make file 1 to 100.

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,130
OK so if I go ahead and do that we shall see that.

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,990
Inside each of these folders now we should have 100 files so there be others folder one now has for

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,980
1 to 100.

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,760
If I pick another one have folder 26 for one to 100 and so on if we go all the way down to folder 402

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,040
that's got its own 100 files.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,590
So you can really start seeing now how powerful the shell is when you've got all these different pieces

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,770
that you can use together.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,280
OK.

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,190
Now what we've done is we've made a folder called haystack 500 folders in each of those 100 files.

55
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,870
OK.

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,320
So about 50000 files if my math is all right.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,170
So now what we're going to do is I'm going to just type something here it's a it don't worry about how

58
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,740
it works but I'm going to type a bit a bit of code here that's going to create in one of the run in

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,780
one of the folders.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,620
OK.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,570
One of the folders from one to 500 what we're going to do is we're going to find a file that we're going

62
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,830
to make a file called Neidl Dr. XTi.

63
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,530
OK.

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,980
So what this is saying is touch inside a random folder.

65
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,280
It can be folder 1 to 500 any random number in the file called needle that 60.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,660
So we've created a file called needle that takes t in somewhere in the haystack but we don't know where

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,540
and it's our job now to use the find command in order to find it.

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,950
OK.

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,900
So how can we find the needle.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,610
Let's have a think through this clear the screen and maximize it.

71
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,410
So let's just take a look how we might do this.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,510
So first of all we can use the find command.

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,210
OK.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,420
And we're going to start where are we going to start.

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,430
We probably start with the haystack folder.

76
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,310
OK we know it's in the haystack so we're going to start searching from that point.

77
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,270
And we know that it's a file right.

78
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,150
So we don't need to look at all the directories but remembering that the find command will by default

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,030
list out files and directories.

80
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,210
So we need to worry about searching through all the you know searching and returning folders let's just

81
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,500
look for files.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,830
And we know that its name is Nido Dottie axium way.

83
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,550
OK.

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,610
OK.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,660
So if we do that and Precentor and see if it works and it has OK it's found needle that takes the inside

86
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,080
folder.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,110
Four hundred and forty nine.

88
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,700
How awesome is not right we've managed to find the needle in a haystack but now let's try and move it

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,100
to the desktop.

90
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,670
OK.

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,630
So to do that now that we've got the result we will use the exact option to execute something on it.

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,280
Now to move something.

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,050
Remember you would type move than what you want to move and where you want to move it to.

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,230
And remember of course we've got to end everything with a backslash semi-colon.

95
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,970
This is how you and the exec option.

96
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,980
So we are going to move something to somewhere that we want to move it onto our desktop.

97
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,420
So just put a tilter slash desktop.

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,930
OK.

99
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,180
So that is our desktop.

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
That's where we're going to move it.

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,210
And what are we going to move.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,340
Well that file.

103
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,380
So we put a square set of squiggly brackets and it works the same for one file as it would for 100000.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,040
So fingers crossed if we go ahead and do that we press enter.

105
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,300
And now if I just close the terminal and have a look on our desktop we've actually done it we've managed

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,410
to move needle directx t all the way from somewhere inside that haystack of potentially 50000 files

107
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,270
find it and move it to move it to our desktop so that's just how awesome what you've learnt in the past

108
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,920
few videos can be.

109
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,000
So what you've seen in the past few videos is that the find command is a total beast of a command.

110
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,110
You've seen so many so very many things with it.

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
But the main key point I'm just going to go through in a quick summary.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,070
OK so the fine command can be used to execute sophisticated search tasks.

113
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,350
You also see how you've seen how to use the locate command and that's very good for just quick quick

114
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,430
like you know searches.

115
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,660
But if you want to do something very sophisticated find command is what you're going to want to use.

116
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,700
First of all it doesn't use a database whereas the locate commando's the fine command works directly

117
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,230
on your file system which means that it's always going to be correct but it might be slightly slower.

118
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,860
So that's just something to bear in mind.

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,560
And the find command allows you to build up search queries where you can search by the name of the file

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,750
the type of the thing that you're searching for the size and so much more.

121
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,000
OK you can see examples of those in the man page just type man then find and you'll be able to read

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,440
the manual page for the find command.

123
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,060
There's just so much that it can do.

124
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,160
OK.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,560
And once you've got this big list of results you can use the exec option to execute another command

126
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,250
on each of those results.

127
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,720
Just remember to end that with the backslash than a semi-colon.

128
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,920
And if you're working with a small number of files and you're doing something potentially destructive

129
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:17,530
like deleting or removing or something like that or moving files then you know use the OK option instead.

130
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,960
Because then it will prompt you to say is this one OK or is this OK or is this OK and you've got to

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,130
authorize it every time.

132
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,830
Because that's something to bear in mind as well.

133
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,170
Now after what you've learned from the last few years about the find command everything else that you

134
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,400
can learn in the next few videos is going to seem really like a breeze.

135
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,900
OK so in the next video I'm going to be showing you how to open files on the command line and read what's

136
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,840
inside them.

137
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,900
And also be making plenty of kitten jokes.

138
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,080
So for all that good stuff.

139
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll see you in the next video.
