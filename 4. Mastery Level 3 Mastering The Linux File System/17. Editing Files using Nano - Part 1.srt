00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,660
Hello you beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,680
You going to learn how you can edit files from the command line using a really cool command line program

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,140
called Nano.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,270
So in this video and the next video I'm going to show you how you can use a command called Nano to edit

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,550
and create files using a user friendly command line interface.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,080
And by the end of the next few videos you're going to know how to edit files in nano.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,270
And when you combine this with the commands that you've already learned so far in this section it's

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,980
very likely that you'll be able to get many of your file related tasks done with Linux without ever

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,000
having to leave the command line and therefore you'll be able to maximize your productivity on Linux.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,340
So this is going to be awesome.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,590
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,240
All right.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,700
So in this lecture we're going to make a file called Diary Datti ex-state using the Nano command.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,480
Now the diary Datti X-C file doesn't actually exist yet but that's OK.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,670
We can also create the file using nano.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,920
So if we type not let's go to the desktop first let's head over to the desktop and then if we type nano

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,200
diary Dr XTi OK and I press enter.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,740
You'll notice that our terminal has changed its look and we're actually now editing a file called diry

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,480
that takes tape as you can see at the top.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,330
In the Nano editor as you can see here nano version 2.0 eight point six.

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,050
Apparently now we can type what ever we want in here.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:36,220
So for example I could type hello my name is Ziyad and I teach Linux and Python courses and more.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,910
OK.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
And it works just like any other graphical text editor that you've ever used before.

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,100
And you can just type directly there in the shell.

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,180
Now down the bottom you can see that there's actually a little toolbar that tells you some of the things

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,150
that you can do in nano and the options are in the white squares and then in the form of keyboard shortcuts

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,400
solitaire you have to read them.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,820
OK.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,570
So in nano The little arrowhead that you see here the little hat or the carrot symbol means the control

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,630
key on your keyboard.

32
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,920
So for example here we have the GET HELP command over to get help.

33
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,010
I guess option from the toolbar and it's given this this shortcut here it's got the arrow head and then

34
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,360
a capital G.

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,350
So if we press control on our keyboard and press g which is exactly what we do is just control Engy

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,470
together that executes that command and we can see here that we have now when in the Get Help menu and

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,790
we can scroll down and see some help about using nano.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,640
OK.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,480
And we can see here that there's some to close this we would need to press control and X because you

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,270
can see the little arrow and then an X server was controlling X Chewbacca there and we're back writing.

41
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,720
OK.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,420
We can also close Nano for example by pressing control an X and it will say do you want to say yes or

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,910
no let's just click cancel by control and see that we are both canceled we're still back in.

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,410
OK.

45
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,880
So how would we save this.

46
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,220
How do we save this diry directx t in in our home folder glossary on our desktop sorry because you can

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,610
see up here shopfront says that we're in our desktop.

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,190
Well to do that in nano you would use the right function.

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,880
So writing a file is a fancy way of saying saving a file so saving and writing are basically the same

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,590
thing.

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,510
And so to write a file we need to press control and oh so we've got the arrow the little carat symbol

52
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,500
here which means the control key and oh.

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,830
So that means we've lost control.

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh and now it's asking us what do you want to save as let's save it as diary takes t and we press enter

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,320
it will say it wrote three lines but we can see here that we've actually got diry dot TXI takes.

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,750
If we open that in any other data we can see that that file has indeed been created.

57
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,620
So I could write something in here I could say like you know something like Jack and Jill went up the

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,790
hill.

59
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,340
All right and then press control and press enter.

60
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,760
And if I press control an x x it OK it's gone away.

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,500
But if I look inside diabetic's a save that data in that Jack and Jill went up the hill.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,030
So it's the Nano is a text editor that you can control from the command line.

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,160
So isn't that incredible.

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,540
You can now edit files without needing to load up graphically intensive editors.

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,990
And plus working with files like this will work pretty much anywhere even if you have remotely access

66
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,570
to a server that might not have a graphical user interface installed.

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,480
Text editors such as Nano will still work.

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
So what other things can nano do.

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,390
Well let's just work our way across the options.

70
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,250
Now we've seen how to get help how to quit using control and X and how to write or save files using

71
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,090
control no.

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,370
What about the lead file option down here the control and our well read file allows you to get content

73
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,870
from another file and basically place it inside of this one.

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,890
So if I head back to our shell if we exit and we try to create a file that says happy birthday and we

75
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,820
echo happy birthday into a file called birthday party X-C we see the birthday party XTi has been created.

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:26,180
If we are back open up again the diary takes tea and we head down the bottom and we press control and

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,470
our control in our is full read file and it's going to say which file do you want to insert.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,360
And notice it says from dot slash.

79
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,550
That means from this directory.

80
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,270
OK.

81
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,800
So let's let's try and sell it.

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,800
So the one you actually insert data from his birthday.

83
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,610
XTi.

84
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,880
And if I press enter you can see that happy birthday has just been inserted.

85
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,070
So that started reading files What about the where is option.

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,900
Well the where is option is control and W and what that does is basically search for words in your file.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,520
So if we head back up to the top of the file and we press control and W now we can search for words

88
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,690
that search for the word birthday.

89
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,230
So if we type birthday and press Enter we now see that Nano has jumped us right down to where the word

90
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,720
birthday starts.

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,890
And so we can edit it from there on.

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,740
Now by default the where is option search is forward in a file and it searches in a case insensitive

93
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,340
manner.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,340
So that means that uppercase and lowercase don't matter.

95
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,690
So if I went up here and I searched for birthday or in uppercase.

96
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,370
Actually you can notice that it shows you what you search beforehand.

97
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,410
So I'm just going to put both in uppercase we can see that it actually didn't matter.

98
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:50,080
And it found birthday even though birth it was all in lowercase So where researches in a case insensitive

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,870
manner and or by default search is forward.

100
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,200
But if we had down to the bottom of the files if we shift down here and use control w again you can

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,660
see down the bottom if I maximize the screen maybe it makes it a bit clearer that there are actually

102
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,270
other options that pop up as well.

103
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,150
OK.

104
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,130
Now some of these options begin with the the carrot symbol the heart which means the control key but

105
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,170
some start with this.

106
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,380
M minus.

107
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,570
OK you can see em minus C minus or minus B minus J.

108
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,840
So what's the minus mean without minus.

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,330
Stands for modify.

110
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:34,450
And this is usually the alt key on your keyboard so the HLT key so you can see here that we've got the

111
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,440
M and minus C option which stands for case sensitive.

112
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,880
So if our press Alton's see you can see now that it has changed so that we are now searching in a case

113
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,170
sensitive way.

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,200
OK so if I now search for actually hold on as well because this is only going a search forward so I

115
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,720
can if I press alt and be to search backwards as well.

116
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,340
When I begin to search case sensitive and backwards for birthday in uppercase I will see that nothing

117
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,310
was found.

118
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,930
You see but if all you do just like the control and you see it saved our settings is going to be case

119
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,900
sensitive and backwards benefices birthday all lowercase we see that that has been found.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,820
OK.

121
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,410
So that that's quite awesome right.

122
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,990
You can also modify the way that these commands behave.

123
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,640
So if you see m minus that means press the old key the HLT key on your keyboard.

124
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,660
And if you see the triangle we have the little arrowhead That's the control key on your keyboard and

125
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,950
that will cover pretty much everything that you'll do in nano.

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,560
So let's just head back to our normal menu here.

127
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,530
So in the interests of time we're going to cut the video here and we're going to pick it right up in

128
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,410
the next video.

129
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,980
We will go through the rest of the options that you have in nano.

130
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,800
So I hope this was useful you've seen that nano is a text editor that you can open from your command

131
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,530
line that allows you to do all your file editing stuff without ever leaving the command line.

132
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,110
So I can just say hey we've got dormi that takes day at it to make some changes save it x.

133
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,390
And we're back in the command line so it gives you a really nice way of editing files and getting back

134
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,080
to what you were doing.

135
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,500
So let's just get rid of say the exit clear the screen and we're good to go continue on with our work.

136
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,570
So let's pick this up in the next video to take a look at the other options that Nano has to offer.
