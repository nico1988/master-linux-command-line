00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,870
Hello the beautiful people and welcome to this video what you're going to be learning about one of the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,740
most useful and most important commands on all of Linux.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,640
The find command now the find command is used to execute sophisticated search tasks on your file system

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,450
and there is so much stuff that you can do with the fine command that we're going to break about discussion

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,830
into a few videos and in the next few videos what you're going to learn is you're going to learn how

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,010
to use the fine come and see what the fine commands default behavior is.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,900
You can learn how to control the search depth that the find command search is on your file system.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,870
You can learn how to search by type So how to get the file.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,240
The find said come on to only return files or directories.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,700
I've had to search by name so if you know exactly what you're looking for you can search by name and

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,890
how to search by file size so you can say hey fine come and find me all the files that are bigger than

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,430
5 megabytes or smaller than 10 kilobytes for example or something in between.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,830
I'm one of the really cool things about the fine command is that once you get this big list of results

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:02,640
as you'll see in the videos you can execute other commands or other pipelines on each of those results.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,080
We're going to show you how to do that and you're going to have a really powerful tool in your Linux

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,310
toolkit for manipulating loads of files at once it's going to be awesome.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,800
So by the end in general you're going to be able to perform sophisticated search tasks with the fine

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,440
commands that that's it in a nutshell and you to want to pay attention to this section for sure because

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,100
this may be very useful for your assignment.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,890
Hint hint.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,910
So I hope you enjoy it.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,550
Let's go ahead and jump over into a buntu and start playing with the find command.

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,180
All right so here we are in our home directory.

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,220
So let's just go ahead and see how the find command will work by default.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,150
So the default behavior of the find command.

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,380
If we just go ahead and run a find is to list every single file and every single folder there is lower

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,190
down in our file system than the current folder that we're in.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,560
OK.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,550
And everything inside the folder that we're in.

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,000
OK.

31
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,030
So good because we're currently in our working directory.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,960
If I just hit if I just type find and press and we see a big long list of every single file and every

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,360
single folder there is in our home directory and below it.

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:18,920
OK so it will go into every folder every hidden folder and expand and expand and expand out and list

35
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,460
everything.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,370
So for example here we've got our pictures folder.

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,100
OK.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,090
It will not just show our pictures folder.

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,880
It'll also show that we have a folder inside the picture folder called holiday.

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,840
Have a file inside the picture folder called Find Me 6 Dr. X Take for example we got our desktop we've

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,290
got find me 1.60 and our desktop itself.

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,270
Videos and videos slash find me 3.0.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,200
So Orlistat the folders and everything side them.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,760
And if there are folders inside those folders then it will do exactly the same.

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,200
It will go into those folders.

46
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,410
Expand those out and if there's other folders that it will go into those folders and expand out to an

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,490
infinite depth.

48
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,250
It will just go as deep as possible into your file system from starting where and starting in the current

49
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,350
directory.

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,860
OK.

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,960
So this is an immediate difference for us between the locate command and the find command.

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,600
So the find command will list out files and folders but the locate command will only list files and

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,300
the find command does not need a database in order to work the find command just works right there and

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,030
then so it's always up to date because it operates directly on our system it doesn't use a database.

55
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,610
So it's always up to date.

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,190
But the one downside of that is it's slightly slower than using a database.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,140
So that's a tradeoff to bear in mind.

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,080
OK.

59
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,560
So because the find command will list every single file below where you give it you can actually also

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,070
for example give it the slash folder in the base folder for the entire system.

61
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,130
And this will list every single file and every single folder on the entire system.

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,830
So that's a fun thing to try if you're bored and you potentially want to smash your computer.

63
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:06,460
But you know if you give it find slash ATC then it will list everything on the system below ATC and

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,600
you can see it's giving us files and folders.

65
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:16,280
If I give it a find slash home slashes Ziyad slash documents for example it will list everything below

66
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,760
the documents folder.

67
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,120
OK so we can see that it's given us the documents folder and the find me 2.6 inside there.

68
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,730
OK.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:34,190
And if I if I make it on documents folder if I make another folder let's call it blah blah let's just

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,030
call it that and copy and paste into there we're going to call it.

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,170
We're going to call this one.

72
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,540
Test DOT takes t.

73
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,410
OK.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,160
Now if I do find again with the documents folder OK for home slashes Ziyad I should do this.

75
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,240
Do the Tilda.

76
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,580
OK.

77
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,020
What's going to happen here is you'll see that it's done the down the block folder as well and it's

78
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,450
gone into the folder to find test RTX take.

79
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:03,960
OK.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,450
So it said we sold it.

81
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,780
Look in the documents folder it listed out find me too and it's all under the folder here called blah.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,320
And I opened it and listed everything inside there.

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,700
If I make another folder called blah blah.

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,820
And inside there I copy and paste it so it says test to Dottie XTi.

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,580
And now I just say find everything in the Documents folder you'll see that it's also listing out blah

86
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,840
blah and test to find kind of searching deeper and deeper and deeper into the file system to an infinite

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,760
depth.

88
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,600
OK.

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,350
So that's something to bear in mind.

90
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,320
And it starts either with the current directory.

91
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,220
So I can start at the home directory which is where we are at the minute.

92
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,820
OK.

93
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,100
All you where ever you give it.

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,950
So if I'm start tell to start at the Documents folder it will start there and continually dig deeper

95
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,900
into the file system until it showed you every file and every folder no matter whether they're hidden

96
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,160
or not it doesn't matter.

97
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,860
So every file in every folder deeper than that point on the file system.

98
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:13,000
So just to make this clear if I go to the documents folder because I'm currently in the Documents folders

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,920
you can see by the PWT command if now I would just run the find command and because the find command

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,420
will start by default at the folder we're currently in.

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,120
If I do that you can see now that it started listing out the same stuff as up here it's side.

102
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,090
So with that we've got the blog folder the blog slash blah blah I am going into showing this test to

103
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:41,330
and test and find me to exactly what we were getting in our documents folder up here because we were

104
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,790
in the Documents folder when we ran the find command.

105
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,390
So you can either be in the directory that you want to start searching from or if you're not for example

106
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,340
we're not in the sloshy DC folder.

107
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,950
We can start the search from there and it will search from the EDC folder and continue to go to an infinite

108
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,830
depth from that point.

109
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,280
OK.

110
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,970
So that's what the find command is it doesn't use a database it operates directly on your file system

111
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,310
so it's a bit slower than the locate command but it's incredibly powerful.

112
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,090
So I think you've understood the basics of what the find command does in the next video we're going

113
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,700
to show you how you can customize some of its behavior starting with how you can control can control

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,180
the depth to which it searches and what it searches for.

115
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,590
OK.

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,820
So the find command search is from where you get it or from the current directory by default and the

117
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,200
next video we're going to take a look at how you can can control some of the way that it searches so

118
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,580
see you in the next video.
