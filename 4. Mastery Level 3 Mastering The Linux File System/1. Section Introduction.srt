Hello you beautiful people are welcome to this section of the course on the Linux file system.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:05,980
OK.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,700
So with this section you're going to be learning a whole load of commands that will show you how to

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,600
manipulate files using the Linux command line.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,920
And then we're going to start off by talking about the Linux file system and what files actually are

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,680
from the file systems perspective.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,800
And when you understand that you're going to move on to discussing how you can move around the file

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,690
system and create files using the command line.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,250
Then you'll learn a whole host of new commands such as copying renaming deleting moving pasting searching

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,010
for files across a whole file system viewing files searching for text within files sorting data and

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,380
also creating file backups and archives for storage and the commands that you're going to learn in this

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,000
section are super powerful and come with a lot of options and ways for you to customize their behavior.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,390
Which is great but is a super useful tip Don't worry about memorizing all the different command options

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,010
in this section but instead just learn about the possibilities that exist for each command and know

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,500
that these videos the cheat sheets that are provided and the commands manual pages will always be available

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,210
for you to use as reference.

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,660
So I hope hope you are as excited as I am because after the section you're going to have a whole lot

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,880
of new commands to use in your pipelines.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,590
Also be able to interact with your whole computer and do 99 percent of your daily work in a whole new

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,880
way and you'll find that with the techniques that you learn in this section you'll find them much faster

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,590
more powerful and more effective than the graphical methods that you'll most likely using right now.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,890
And if you're like me you'll likely never go back.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,190
OK so it's good to be a really revolutionary section of the Course feel inexorability is abilities.

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,800
All that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
