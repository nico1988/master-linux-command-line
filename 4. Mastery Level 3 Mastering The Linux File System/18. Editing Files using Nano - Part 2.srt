00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,870
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,810
And welcome back to our discussion of how to use the Nano command line text editor to get your work

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,200
done.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,090
So we were in the last video we were discussing some of the options that Nano has and we discussed the

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,090
Right-O option the read option the where is option and we got up to the replace option.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,570
So let's actually use the read form option to read in birthday doc text again.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,620
So we're going to say birthday Dot text and you see that we've got happy birthday.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,110
Read into the file once again.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,400
And the reason I've done that is so that we can now use the replace command and you can see here that

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,450
the replace command although replace option here is activated by pressing control and a backslash.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,360
Now I find the backslash next to the letter Zed on my keyboard but it might be wherever that is on your

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,280
on your computer or on your keyboard.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,710
OK.

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,060
So the press control and backslash.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,180
And now it's asking me what I want to replace.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,950
So let's replace birthday.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,920
OK.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,040
And we're going to replace it with code day.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,370
And when I press Enter it's going to now go through each instance of where it found the word birthday

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,770
and ask if you want to replace it.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,640
Now you can see it on the bottom here is because I do want to place this instance I could say yes I

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,020
could say no or I could say all or I could say control and see for cancel.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,370
So let's just press a to make it replace all.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,500
And we see that every instance of birthday has been replaced with the word code day.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,710
So happy code day to you you beautiful person.

26
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,860
So that's replacing text what about cutting text cutting text is the next one.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,900
So cutting is very easy you can see here we've got this line that says Happy code day.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,030
If I press control and K to cut that basically deletes the line and if I want to paste that.

29
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,810
So basically it's just like cutting and pasting just in your normal everyday computer use.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,860
So if I want to uncut it I press control and you and I can do that as many times as I want.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,890
So this is a very very happy code day.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:21,020
We can also justify the text using control and JS control obvious NJ we'll see that the text has been

33
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,070
set so that it takes up the full width of the screen are controlling you now to unjustified.

34
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,480
But you can see if I press control NJ to justify the text the paragraph that I mean takes up the full

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,190
width of the right context for with the screen and for birth control and you can justify it.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,070
So something to bear in mind if you look at control J is justified.

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,130
And before you justify control you is uncut text.

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,550
But if birth control and J.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,370
You see that control you has now switched to justify kind it tells you here you can now justify controlling

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,730
you.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,670
It goes back to the way that it was.

42
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,540
So up next we've got the two spell option which is basically a spell checker.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Now by default a spell checker isn't set up for Nonno.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,720
So if I press control t it will say spellchecking failed error invoking spell like OK.

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,100
What that means is that there's a spell checker not actually set up but we can set one up.

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,370
So let's just save our file by pressing control in 0 to write it.

47
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,510
Yes that'll do.

48
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,520
And then press control X to exit and clear the screen with control and l see a lot of keyboard shortcuts

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,330
going on here.

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:34,640
So to actually edit the text they that's sort of a spell checker that is used for Nonno that's in the

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,040
Nano configuration file which is actually located in our ETSI folder in a file called Nano or C so that's

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,920
open not really ironically with nano because if we do that here we are we've now opened our nano Ossy

53
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,810
So it's slash ATC slash nano Ossy.

54
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:01,610
So if I show you that graphically where where we're going we are in our base directory by going to other

55
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,360
location I think.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,250
So this is the slash folder.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,510
Then you go ATC.

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:14,920
So sloshy UTC then somewhere in here there'll be a file called none and none of us see this.

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,130
If we click on NORC that's basically what we've opened.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,960
OK but let's make sure that we open it in in here.

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,060
OK.

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,500
Actually at the minute this file is in fact on ridable because we don't have the Persians to edit it.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,820
So to make that actually editable we need to do pseudo nano sloshy UTC slash nano RC.

64
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,940
OK so this pseudo bare basic alleged to run this command is the administrator but we'll come onto that

65
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,370
a bit more later in the course.

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,130
You enter your password that you normally use for logging in.

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,360
And now you can edit the file.

68
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,170
OK.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,080
Now there's a line in here that has the word a spell or spell in it.

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,410
So let's find that by using the where is Command says where is aspell press enter.

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,180
And it found it.

72
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,760
OK.

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,650
So this line it says here use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.

74
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,960
This option does not properly have a default value.

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,390
OK so to get rid of that actually to make that actually happen we just need to get rid of this hash

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,960
symbol and get rid of the leading space.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,860
Now there's no there's no hash just set Spellar.

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,790
I spell dash ecstasy just like that.

79
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,740
And we write out and close.

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:37,010
And now if we go back into nano for our diary text if we press control and t to actually stop the spell

81
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,620
checker we now have a spell checker working so it's not quite cool right we just use Nonno to edit Nonno.

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,350
It's awesome.

83
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,490
So here we are.

84
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,310
It's going through a spell checker is telling me my name is wrong.

85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,220
Well that's charming isn't it.

86
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,690
There you go.

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,700
That's how you can actually go about setting up your spell checker and you can just enter things in

88
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,850
here.

89
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,690
So if I wanted to change my name to let's say Yoda which of course I do.

90
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,140
Because that's totally awesome.

91
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,550
I just enter five and you see that my name is now Yoda and it's a fact because it's on a video.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,990
OK.

93
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,890
So if I now go I can also close a human to any of these Otterman you can ignore replace Agta dictionary

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,440
and replace all or ignore all or whatever it might be.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,280
But let's just press X to exit and there we are we're back into normal stuff.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,300
So once you've edited that all you've got to do it when you get to that so that your spell checker works

97
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,140
you're good to go and it is possible to to also add different dictionaries and stuff like that as well

98
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,780
and you can find that information online as well.

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,130
OK so there we are that's how you do spellchecking and control and see is apparently tells you your

100
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,560
current positions if I press control and say they will tell us I'm on line 1 out of ninety five percent

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,830
of the way through column one to 70 characters 0 out of 275.

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,330
So if I move over here now and I press control and say change I'm now on line 7 column 10.

103
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,520
So for us this is this is good you know if you are working on a file and you want to give it to someone

104
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,010
and you say Oh hey can you change this file at this given position or you're giving people instructions

105
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,180
on how to use a file you say online 7 in column 11 change this text.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,630
OK.

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,130
So in fact just to show you let me let me actually save that.

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,300
Yes.

109
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:33,840
If I go to any slash ETSI slash Nonno or C file and I can search for where is that a spell.

110
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:41,250
Now I can tell you I'm on a spell and if I press control and see I can see here that I'm on line 172.

111
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,390
So if you want to set your spell checker go to line 172 and that's the line that you need to edit.

112
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,190
For example that would be one way to do it right.

113
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,510
So I can close that get back into the direct text.

114
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:59,180
Now we're getting through the next option is control and under score and that allows us to go to a line.

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,810
OK.

116
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,880
So if I press control on the scope and first control the underscore.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,420
Oh sorry I'm pressing the wrong button here.

118
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,580
There we go because it just goes in a bit of a weird position on my computer so controlling.

119
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,970
And he says enter the line number and column number.

120
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,820
So let's go to line 10.

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Column 2 and then we are in line 10 column to see if I can actually get this stuff to get a bit bigger.

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,380
There we go I've made the font a bit bigger.

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,420
So control on the score done it because I have to press control and shift and underscore there we go

124
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,720
on mine anyway.

125
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,630
So so now you're going to do a line number and column numbers or let's say Line 9 column 12.

126
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,200
There we go.

127
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,160
We are in line on Ivan columns aren't separated by spaces separated by letters.

128
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,650
OK.

129
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,120
So here are his column 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,490
OK.

131
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,420
That's that's where we are this way we might get two if you want to call it 12 on whatever line.

132
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:05,060
So if I said to you let's ask Slash ETSI slash non-war was fall and I looked for using using the where

133
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,060
is command.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,900
I do control the B and I search for a spell and I get to this line.

135
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,580
I'm like Huh.

136
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,600
Where is this line.

137
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,450
Control and see which is composition.

138
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,610
It says Line 172.

139
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,870
OK so now on your computer.

140
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,460
OK.

141
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:28,040
When you open the file you get like ha Z and says Line 172 surplus control and underscore into line

142
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,890
172 press enter.

143
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,630
And I've ended up at the correct line so you can see how useful that might be if you're collaborating

144
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,890
on something with someone.

145
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,590
So let's get back into our diary duct tape.

146
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,420
We've then got undo and redo.

147
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,100
So if I for example cut out all these things here and then I was like oh I don't want that.

148
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,330
Let me undo.

149
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,610
You can see I just undo and it undid all those bleatings I could also press Olt and remember this could

150
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,220
be escape or command depending on your keyboard layout and just the modify key whatever that is for

151
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,770
you.

152
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:16,480
On my keyboard it's old but if I press alt and we should redo Altan you undo redo Olson.

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,170
Alton you.

154
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,340
Yeah yeah.

155
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,410
I've broke it now but you get the point.

156
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,280
So.

157
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,160
So that's how you can undo and redo stuff.

158
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,790
And instead of cutting Could you see if I could.

159
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,630
Now I can uncut instead of cutting.

160
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,250
You can actually just directly copy.

161
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,260
So here you've got to do all.

162
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,400
And the number 6 for press ultimate number 6.

163
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:45,880
Now I can press control in you and I'll start pasting so maybe if I if I do it here Alton's 6 and then

164
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,940
press control on you.

165
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,690
Now I'm copying and pasting just like that.

166
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,910
So that saves you from actually cutting and Mark text as far as I've seen.

167
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,060
I don't use that one very often but as far as I can tell all that does is allow you to highlight stuff

168
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,840
so yeah it just it just kind of allows you to highlight stuff.

169
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,630
So there we go.

170
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:14,040
That's basically everything you need to know about using the Nano command so you are you beautiful people

171
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,520
in the last couple of videos you become very familiar with using the Nano command line based text editor.

172
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,570
Now the benefit of using a command line based text editors such as nano is that you can get all of your

173
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,980
work done without leaving the command line which basically maximizes your productivity.

174
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,510
It's a command line editors have lower resource requirements than graphical equivalents so you don't

175
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,710
need as much hardware usage in order to actually run them.

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,920
And also if you are remote administering something like a server the techniques you've learnt here would

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,540
still work because nano basically comes with every version of Linux at least the most common ones anyway.

178
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,630
So you've learned how to use nano and we've looked at a lot of keyboard shortcut options and you saw

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,600
how to use and pretty much all of those.

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,530
So you don't have to memorize them don't worry about that now you've got a bit of an idea about how

181
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,070
they work.

182
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,020
Honestly not I was just a text editor.

183
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,720
You can just type text in there you can write code in there whatever you want to do and you can edit

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,610
files in there.

185
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,410
But just bear in mind that the tools are the options in there are accessed using keyboard shortcuts.

186
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,880
So if you see this little hat then that means the control key.

187
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,700
And if you see minus that either the old escape or command keys on your keyboard depending upon your

188
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,920
layout to try them out see which one works on your keyboard.

189
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,190
On mine it was all it might be different on yours.

190
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,010
And you also saw that you can edit how nano works by editing its configuration file which is located

191
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,180
at slash ETSI slash nano or C.

192
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,930
So a lot of this stuff is going to be probably for reference for you so you've got it here in this video

193
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,720
in this course to refer back to later on if you want to look anything up.

194
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,810
But really Nano is very simple to use you to type Nano and then they found that you want to edit.

195
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,440
And you know you can just go and edit it like any other text file.

196
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,330
So there you are you know know how to end it follows from the command line and should be feeling quite

197
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,210
a lot more like a computer wizard.

198
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,190
At this point.

199
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,930
So with all this super awesome file creation moving copying and pasting and editing that you'll be doing.

200
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,990
It's possible that you might want to find where certain important configuration files are located so

201
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,980
that you can edit them or where that fall that Ukraine is run off to but you don't want to have to go

202
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,340
through each folder manually to look for them.

203
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,790
So in the next video you're going to learn how to search for files anywhere on your system using the

204
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,770
locate command locate command is one of my favorites and I can't wait to show you.

205
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,210
So for all that good stuff.

206
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,780
I'll see you in the next video.
