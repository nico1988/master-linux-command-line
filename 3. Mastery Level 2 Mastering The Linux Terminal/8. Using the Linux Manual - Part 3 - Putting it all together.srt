00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,190
Hello you beautiful people know in the last video you learn how to search the manual for specific keywords.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,750
Open up manual pages and how to read them to learn how to use specific commands.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,770
But there was quite a lot of stuff in that video and a lot to take in.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,560
So in this video what we want to do is we want to give you some practice.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,690
So in this video we're going to take a look at a completely new command that we haven't seen before

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,630
and we're going to learn how to use it.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,690
We're going to search the manual for it.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,910
We're going to learn how to use it using the synopsis in the manual page.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,440
We're going to read through its various options.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,310
I'm going to try some of them out and see how you can customize commands and stuff like that.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,030
And the idea is that this is going to show you how to independently search for stuff using the manual

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,300
we're going to put the whole process together we can take everything we've learned put it all together

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,040
and show you how you would learn about a new command from scratch.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,100
And the idea is you can have the independence to search for new stuff and learn how it works and that's

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,750
really where the value comes from the manual.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,970
It's not having people randomly show you things that they find cool is being able to go out there and

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,920
find stuff that you find cool and learn how to use it independently and it can take your Linux abilities

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,840
to a whole new level.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,770
So let's go ahead and jump into it and start learning about our brand new command.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,610
OK so what we're going to do is we're going to look at a command that will allow us to list out what

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,460
is in a folder also known as a directory.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,940
OK so we want to come and that will list out a directory's contents.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,330
OK.

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,140
So now that we know that.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,410
Let's go ahead and search for what might be available so the first step is to search for what might

26
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,670
be available in the manual and you might have to try this multiple times.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,970
OK you might not get the search terms available right away you might have to try different words and

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,120
different keywords but let's try that.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,920
So let's try this type the man come and give it the k option and then we tell what we want to search

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,480
for.

31
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,950
Now I'm going to put in quotes list directory contents.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,630
OK.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,340
And the reason I put it in quotes is because I want to search for this search term in one go.

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,190
I don't want to search for the word list then the word directory than the word contents.

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,040
I want to search for list directory contents in one go.

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,170
OK so once I do that I press enter.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,090
And here we go.

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,520
We get some results.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,470
OK.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,560
Now they all seem to pretty much do what we want right.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,450
They all seem to say list directory contents but the one that I'm specifically looking for I've heard

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,310
about online is the l s command.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,560
OK now the ls command is one that we will come onto as well in the layout section of the course but

44
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,300
we can see that it's a user command because it's in the first section of the manual.

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,610
So we could open it using MAN 1 LS but because it's in the first section we would have to have even

46
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,310
have the one we can type man.

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,880
S And here we go.

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,060
Where in the manual page for the ls command.

49
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,110
So there we are now right at the top.

50
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,050
We can see the where in the press command is in the first section of the manual which is apparently

51
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,950
user commands and we can see the name of the command is ls and it lists directory contents and that's

52
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,530
from the name section.

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,110
Now looking at the synopsis section we can see that if you type L S then you can have multiple optional

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,640
options.

55
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,890
We know they're optional because they're surrounded by square brackets and you can have multiple of

56
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,910
them because they've got the ellipsis after it and then you have multiple optional filenames or paths

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,670
to directories and can have multiple of those because we can see the dot dot dot.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,030
But the one thing that you might notice is because everything else is optional right.

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,780
The only thing you actually need to enter is the ls command itself and it will work.

60
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,790
So let's try that.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,150
OK let's try and see that we don't even have to give the command any input so if we press lower case

62
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,420
Q to quit We're back in.

63
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,760
We're backing out of it all.

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,950
Now as I said the thing we need to do is enter the Alaskan itself.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:47,730
If I just type LS I press enter that it has indeed listed all the contents of our home directory which

66
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,200
is the directory that we're currently in.

67
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,960
So how cool.

68
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,010
OK now go back in the man page just go back in the main page.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,550
We can see that there's a whole bunch of options that we can use we can look down in the description

70
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,440
section.

71
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,810
It says here that list information about the files which is the current working directory by default

72
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,890
sort's entries alphabetically.

73
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,750
If non of these options or the sort option is specified and mandatory arguments to long options are

74
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,350
mandatory for short options as well.

75
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,530
OK so that's fair enough.

76
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,130
Now we've got loads of different options in here.

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,640
OK loads of them let me just scroll through loads of them guys.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,170
OK.

79
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,920
So memorizing all these is just not possible.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,130
OK.

81
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,630
Just don't even don't even try.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,240
You're not going to be able to do all that and even if you did there were thousands and thousands of

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,750
Linux commands so it's kind of a waste of time to do it all.

84
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
This is what you need to know how to use a manual page effectively.

85
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,580
OK.

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,220
There's a whole bunch of options.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,900
One that I might like to show you which is a good one is the l option.

88
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,700
OK.

89
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,980
Now of course you can browse through these and have a look at what they do.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,520
But you've got the option here which stands for long listing format.

91
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:58,810
OK.

92
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,540
So let's try that.

93
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,230
Sounds pretty cool.

94
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,320
Let's see what that means.

95
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,760
If I type ls and give it the l option or press enter.

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,050
We now see that everything is kind of listed in a much more detailed fashion.

97
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,720
This was put before and this is the output.

98
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,000
Now OK so we've got much more detailed view of what's in our folder now to explain what this means a

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,330
bit later in the course.

100
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,510
But for now I hope you can see that the process that you might follow for discovering a new command.

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,430
OK we search for manual pages we browsed a few of the options and we tried them out as well as seeing

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,910
how to actually use the command in the first place.

103
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,890
Now let's let's have another look in.

104
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,590
We can see that this is a bit it's a bit difficult to read.

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
Perhaps if we look at the ls command again and we scroll down we can see that there's another option

106
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,110
here called the hate option which stands for human readable I guess you can see here we've got a short

107
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,180
form option dash h or a long form option dash dash human readable.

108
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,370
And this is how you can tell whether whether an option has a long form or not because it will move right

109
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,780
next to it in the manual page.

110
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,910
OK you may want to set some options have long forms and some don't.

111
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,620
And this is how you can tell.

112
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,520
And it says that with the l option and or the s option this will print human readable sizes of files.

113
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,910
For example one kilobyte to integrate four megabytes two gigabytes etc..

114
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,620
OK so let's take a look at that here.

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,600
This column this column here is actually all the file sizes.

116
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,900
And it just says 4000 a nice six or eight thousand nine hundred eighty or whatever it might be.

117
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,000
OK but to make that human readable you can type LS dash L and then give it the option as well and we'll

118
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,340
see that.

119
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,000
Now it's said because it's four kilobytes eight point eight kilobytes and so on and so on.

120
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,140
OK.

121
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,910
But as well because we have a long form option and we don't have to just type hey we might type page

122
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,930
but we could also type dash dash human readable.

123
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,750
I think it was like that.

124
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,710
Let me check if I type.

125
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,620
LS It's dash dash human human readable.

126
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,390
I'm Pop-Pop I apologize human Dasch readable.

127
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,980
OK.

128
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,810
And there we go.

129
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,900
Now we've got exactly the same output that we have before you say.

130
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,350
So you can see here the way we use a long form option which means now we know it's a bit easier to read

131
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,030
what.

132
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,180
Well you know what that means than it is to just see what hate means.

133
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,620
OK.

134
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,400
But it kind of makes the command a bit more difficult to type so there's a bit of a tradeoff there.

135
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,760
But you get the same output.

136
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,480
OK.

137
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,650
So you can see just how useful reading the man pages actually is and if we just go back into the ls

138
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,490
command and be clear the screen go back into the ls command and scroll all the way down.

139
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,540
You will see a section if we we keep scrolling down it's a long manual page much longer than that which

140
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,460
come on right.

141
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,220
You'll see a section that says that is called See also.

142
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:49,100
OK so this section here that says See also it's got a hyperlink and you can click on this hyperlink

143
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,210
or any hyperlink that's in a manual page by holding the control key and left clicking OK.

144
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,770
Now if we control the left click that's going to do if I if I clicked it right.

145
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,530
Have to wait I think there we go.

146
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,870
It's opening up.

147
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,310
So I clicked it multiple times but it's opened up in the Firefox browser.

148
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,380
The link that was in there.

149
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,840
OK.

150
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,820
So it's going to give you more information about the command as long as you have internet access.

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,540
OK so that sometimes in manual pages there are there are links that you can click on so there's another

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,830
one here for example.

153
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,060
Another one here.

154
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,650
If you hold the control key and click them and then you will open up in your browser and you'll be able

155
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,830
to see what they're pointing at.

156
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,080
So that's very very useful.

157
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,700
And that's something you'll definitely want to do if you want more information.

158
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,840
And as a final know although you can find pretty much information on pretty much all the commands that

159
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,890
you'll ever need using the man pages you can't quite get all of them.

160
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,590
So some commands are defined directly in the shell and don't have man pages for them.

161
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
So to find those commands you will need to use the help command instead of the man.

162
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,000
Come on.

163
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,840
Let me just show you what I mean.

164
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,300
OK.

165
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:03,130
So for example one of them is the cd command and the cd command is one you will use all the time.

166
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,820
Actually it's used to change a directory.

167
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,690
You'll see this in the next section of the course.

168
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,610
What about navigating the file system.

169
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,650
But if I type man CD it's like there's no manual entry for the cd command but if I type the help command

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,580
and then do CD we then get something that's very similar to a man page and we can see how to use it.

171
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,380
Here we get a description.

172
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,200
We get the options and so on.

173
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,140
It's like OK so it works pretty much just the same as a manual page.

174
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,790
It's just you have to use help instead to find the commands that are that need the help command to use

175
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,690
if you just type help and press enter.

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,770
You get a big list and every single one of these in here is need needs the needs the help command to

177
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,010
see it.

178
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:52,220
So for example his CD ok for example if we do P.W. day of here if we do man PWT there actually is a

179
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,350
man page for it.

180
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,450
But if for one of those commands it didn't come up with a man page you would just type help.

181
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,510
PETER BEATTIE And it would give you basically the same basic like a very similar kind of output.

182
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,630
So if man doesn't work and you know the command is correct use the help command instead.

183
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,350
And there's a lot of other things in here like for example doing wild loops in the in the shell for

184
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,050
loops and other things like that.

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,710
OK so it's it's quite it's quite an advanced thing more about the shell rather than about the programs

186
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,650
that are installed on your computer.

187
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:20,920
OK.

188
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,070
So that's just something to bear in mind.

189
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:30,290
Now another thing that has actually come to my mind in the ls command here notice this is this works

190
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,310
for pretty much all commands.

191
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,850
Notice when you've got a long form.

192
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:39,590
So for example almost all or block size or ignore backups when you have a long form come on like this.

193
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,820
They tend to break up the words with a dash.

194
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:51,920
OK so ignore dash backups block dash size almost dash all all you know down here full dash time group

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,460
dash directories no dash group Human dash readable.

196
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,180
OK so when you're making a long form option.

197
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,520
When I wanted you know the human readable one instead of going human readable like the mistake I made

198
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,880
before because human is one word and readable is another word is going to be human readable.

199
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,060
And that gives us the output.

200
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,990
OK so that's just something to bear in mind with regards to spelling and things like that.

201
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,570
But the main thing to remember when you are reading these manual pages is each Linux command is designed

202
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,780
to do one thing and do it extremely well.

203
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,760
That's why you've got a the LS kind with so many different options.

204
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,130
Anything that you can possibly imagine to do with listing things out of directories.

205
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,190
The LS command is going to be able to do it.

206
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:39,770
OK.

207
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,480
So that's why the manual pages have a lot of information to really get the information out of that.

208
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,270
Unfortunately if you want to become a master of the ls command or you know even just start using any

209
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,690
new command there's going to be no shortcut to reading.

210
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,980
Unfortunately I wish there was.

211
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,560
You can skim read and sometimes they give you quick intros and quick starts to commands and things like

212
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,510
that in the manual pages but for all these options if you want to learn it you're going to have to read

213
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:05,710
it.

214
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,400
OK so there's no other way around that.

215
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,670
So that's how you will go through and you'll learn about a new command.

216
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,370
So let's do it really quick in quick succession.

217
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,270
We wanted to learn about a command that shows you how to direct your content so we use man with the

218
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,600
k option list directory contents.

219
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,890
It came up with some possible page names.

220
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,740
The sections they were in and the explanations.

221
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,690
The ls command caught our eye we noticed it was in the first section.

222
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,190
So we just typed man ls and gave us the manual page we saw that yes it lists directory contents we see

223
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,350
a quick description and we saw how to use it.

224
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,690
You have to type the ls command.

225
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,870
The options are optional you can have multiple of those and the files are optional and you can have

226
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,800
multiple of those.

227
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,030
So we saw that actually you can just type the ls command and you get some output but there are plenty

228
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,890
of other options.

229
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,190
There's loads of things in here.

230
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,340
One thing that we liked was the idea that you could have a long form option.

231
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,960
OK so the long form option we found it whereas it's down here we found it under L use a long listing

232
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,400
format.

233
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,400
So we had to look at that.

234
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,420
We do ls dat L We got lot.

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,620
We also saw that you can have long form options as well.

236
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,360
OK.

237
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,720
One other thing is that you can see here there's a lower case which gives you one option and uppercase

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,260
which gives you another option.

239
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,780
And here while you've got a lower case b gives you one option an uppercase B gives you another option.

240
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,820
That's very common.

241
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,210
So you need to make sure that when you are spelling things in Linux you get the case correct.

242
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,000
So for example Anastacia will give us that.

243
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,900
But if I do start capital L I didn't even do anything.

244
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,280
OK.

245
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:41,030
So you need to make sure that you get that stuff right and just just for curiosity what does the capital

246
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,820
L say if there is a capital L option.

247
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,960
Yeah dereference when followed when showing falling for mation for a symbolic link.

248
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,440
So information for the file in the link for information for the file the link references rather than

249
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,700
for the link itself.

250
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,000
So there you go.

251
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,740
OK so you need to make sure that your case is correct.

252
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,270
Things have to be spelt precisely you have a very sharp eye and not make mistakes and make sure you're

253
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,350
doing stuff right because the power of these commands is so so powerful they can do so many different

254
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,820
things but you just need to make sure that you enter them correctly.

255
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,260
OK.

256
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,480
So there we go.

257
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,970
That's a quick summary of this video what we're going to do in the next video is we're going to actually

258
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,880
be moving on from the manual.

259
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,370
And what we're going to be showing you is how to how commands take input and actually give output because

260
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,080
one of the most powerful things that Linux commands that you do is to train different commands together

261
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,610
to make up super powerful command pipelines.

262
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,410
Now because each command is amazing at what it does when you can chain them together chain these each

263
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,740
of these separate commands that is amazing what it does but chained them together you can break create

264
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,610
some incredibly powerful functionality with very little effort.

265
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,060
OK.

266
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,590
So I'm going to show you how to do that.

267
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:57,390
But first we need to take a little bit of a look into how commands take input and give output so you

268
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,460
can actually start building together these Capan and pipelines.

269
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,070
You need to understand how they take input and give outputs for all that good stuff.

270
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,700
We see you in the next video.
