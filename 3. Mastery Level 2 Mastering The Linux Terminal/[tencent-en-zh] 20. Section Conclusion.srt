1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,150
你好，你这个漂亮的人。
HELLO YOU BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:02,850
井。
Well.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,470
嗯，你现在一定为自己感到无比自豪。
Well you must be feeling super proud of yourself right now right.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,160
你在课程的这一部分已经走到了这一步，所以为了充分庆祝我想要制作一段视频
You've come so far in this section of the course so to fully celebrate that I wanted to make a video

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,410
快速回顾一下，这样您就可以沉浸在您在
and have a quick recap so that you can soak in all the awesome stuff you've learned in the section of

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,110
这门课。
the course.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,660
因此，您从非常基础的开始，学习了如何使用图形打开和关闭航站楼
So you started off with the very basics and you learned how to open and close the terminal using graphical

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,500
方法，并使用现在广受欢迎的键盘快捷键。
methods and by using And now beloved keyboard shortcuts.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,970
一开始对你来说很陌生，但你还是直接跳了进来，开始打字
And it was all very strange to you at first but you jumped right in anyway and you started typing and

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,940
使用第一个命令，您可以看到DATE命令、CAL命令和ECHO命令。
using your first commands you saw the date command the Cal command and the echo command.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,490
你看到了如何清除你的学期历史。
And you saw how to clear your term history.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,820
我们毕竟不想让任何间谍看历史，我们也不想。
We don't want any spies looking at history after all do we.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,270
他们，我们正在取得进展，但这一切都有些奇怪，你可能不太确定是什么
They we're making progress but it was all kind of weird and you probably weren't too sure of what was

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,410
当您运行命令时，实际上正在运行。
actually going on when you run a command.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,390
然后，您了解了终端和外壳之间的区别。
So then you learned the difference between the terminal and the shell.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,480
您了解到shell解释您键入的命令，就像解释
You learned that the shell is what interprets the commands that you type just like you interpret the

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,730
你所读单词的含义。
meanings of words that you read.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,950
当你理解了什么是实际的命令时，你就了解了命令的一般结构。
And when you understood what commands actually were you learned the general structure of a command.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,070
了解了命令遵循命令名选项参数结构。
Learned the commands follow a command name options arguments structure.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,600
好的。
OK.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,760
现在，因为很明显，尽管命令遵循相似的结构，但它们确实有很大的不同
Now because it became clear that although commands follow a similar structure they do vary quite a bit

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,680
在他们的使用中。
in their usage.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,980
他们每个人都有自己特定的选项和用例，要记住它们是不可能的
They each have their own specific options and use cases and it would be impossible to memorize them

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,480
全。
all.

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,020
因此，您学习了如何查看Linux手册，了解了手册是如何分解的，您可以看到
So you learned how to look in the Linux manual you learned how the manual was broken up and you saw

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,910
如何搜索术语和阅读手册页面，以及如何自己学习新事物和查找
how to search for terms and read the manual pages and how to learn new things for yourself and find

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,170
事情在你需要的时候就去做，而不是必须记住所有的事情。
things as and when you need them rather than having to memorize everything.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,810
这就像在你的电脑上有你自己的个人搜索引擎，这是相当令人难以置信的
So it's like having your own personal search engine for your computer which is pretty incredible in

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,500
这是我的意见。
my opinion.

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,420
现在，我们更深入地讨论，您了解到命令可以将输入作为标准
Now then we took our discussion even deeper and you learned that commands can take input a standard

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,760
输入和命令行参数，它们可以通过标准输出和标准错误数据获得输出
input and command line arguments and they can get output via standard output and standard error data

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,630
溪流。
streams.

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,400
因此，我必须将这些数据流重定向到您希望的任何位置，以及如何将不同的命令连接在一起
So I had to redirect these data streams to wherever you wish and how to pipe together different commands

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290
建造强大的管道。
to build powerful pipelines.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,280
我希望使用T命令和X Ogg命令来获得额外的管道灵活性。
I hope to use the T command and the X Ogg's command for extra pipeline flexibility.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,580
你在这么短的时间内走了这么远，这真的很令人惊讶。
And this really is amazing how far you've come in such a short amount of time.

37
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,880
所以我想制作这个视频来祝贺你到目前为止取得的进步，你做得很好，你这台小电脑
So I want to make this video to congratulate you on your progress so far so well done you little computer

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,200
天才您现在在下一节中，您将学习如何导航Linux文件系统和
genius you now in the next section you're going to learn about navigating the Linux file system and

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,470
您还将学习一些在管道中使用的新构建块。
you'll also learn some new building blocks to use in your pipelines.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,540
但在此之前，我有一个项目要给你完成，这个项目将挑战你建造你的
But before that I have a project for you to complete the project will challenge you to build your very

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,210
拥有Linux命令管道。
own Linux command pipeline.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,060
现在它将会很棒，它将作为荣誉的徽章，因为你已经学到了所有的东西
Now it's going to be awesome and it will serve as a badge of honor that you have learned everything

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,170
我们已经在这一节讲到了这些，这样你们就可以有信心在下一个视频中继续下去了，我是
that we've covered in this section so that you can feel confident moving on now in the next video I'm

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,560
我会给你你的项目摘要。
going to be giving you your project brief.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,970
再次祝贺你做得令人惊叹。
So congratulations once again you're doing amazingly.
