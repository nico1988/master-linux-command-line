00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,370
大家好，漂亮的人们都知道，人们转而使用Linux的最大原因之一就是使用
Hello you beautiful people know one of the biggest reasons for someone to switch to Linux is to use

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,290
可以说，Linux操作系统最强大的功能就是终端。
what is arguably the most powerful feature of the Linux operating system and that is the terminal.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,020
如果你看过一部黑客或电脑天才坐在电脑后面打字的电影
Now if you've ever seen a film where a hacker or a computer genius has sat behind their computer typing

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,330
命令进入他们的计算机屏幕上看起来像是一个大黑盒的东西，这个黑盒被称为
commands into what looks like a big black box on their computer screen that black box is called the

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,170
终点站。
terminal.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,490
现在，整个Linux操作系统一度完全是基于终端的。
Now at one time the entire Linux operating system was purely terminal based.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,500
但是随着时间的推移，到目前为止已经开发出了更多的图形工具，我们有这些漂亮的
But as time has gone on more graphical tools have been developed up until now where we have these beautiful

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,190
桌面环境就像我们在Buntu上看到的那样。
desktop environments like what we see on a buntu.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,120
现在从根本上讲，使用终端和使用普通图形方法之间的主要区别
Now fundamentally the main difference between using the terminal and using normal graphical methods

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,310
甚至在使用Windows或Mac时，您可能已经熟悉的一点是，它不是指向
that you're probably already familiar with from even using a Windows or a Mac is that instead of pointing

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,480
用鼠标点击来控制你的电脑，你就可以用键盘打字了。
and clicking with the mouse to control your computer you'll be typing with the keyboard instead.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,820
现在Linux的独特之处在于，Linux的发展离不开终端。
Now Linux is unique in that the development of Linux is inseparable from the terminal.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,370
这意味着知道如何使用终端可以让您在很大程度上控制如何使用终端
And this means that knowing how to use the terminal gives you pretty much absolute control over how

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,880
您的计算机通过使用终端工作。
your computer works by using the terminal.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,700
您几乎可以在Linux计算机上做任何您想做的事情。
You can do pretty much anything that you want with your Linux computer.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,930
现在，您无法在任何其他操作系统中对您的计算机进行这种级别的控制。
Now you can't get this level of control over your computer in any other operating system.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,080
这使得终端成为一项令人难以置信的学习技能。
And this makes the terminal an incredible skill to learn.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,530
现在，虽然它绝对很棒，但我知道航站楼一开始可能有点吓人
Now although it's absolutely awesome I understand that the terminal can be a bit intimidating at first

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,570
在这段视频中，我们将很容易地开始，我将向您展示如何实际
so in this video we're going to start off nice and easy and I'm going to show you how you can actually

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,330
在Buntu中打开和关闭终端。
open and close the terminal in a buntu.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,710
在本视频结束时，您将在掌握Linux方面迈出非常重要的第一步
And by the end of this video you'll have taken a very important first step in your mastery of the Linux

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,280
操作系统，您还可以随意打开和关闭。
operating system and you'll also be able to open and close at will.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,220
Linux提供的最强大的工具。
The most powerful tool that Linux has to offer.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,580
那么让我们开始吧。
So let's go ahead and get started.

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,390
好的。
All right.

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,580
所以我们现在在一个漂亮的Buntu桌面上。
So here we are in a beautiful buntu desktop.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,790
现在，我将向您展示如何继续使用图形方法打开终端。
Now I'm going to show you how you can go ahead and open the terminal using graphical methods.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,120
现在沿着左下角，你会注意到一组九个点。
Now down the bottom left here you'll notice a a set of nine dots.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
如果你把鼠标悬停在上面，上面写着“显示申请”。
And if you hover over it says show applications.

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,500
如果你点击它，它会以一种相当令人敬畏的方式打开。
If you click on that it will open up in a rather awesome way.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,460
安装在您的计算机上的不同程序的完整列表，您可以四处查看
A whole list of different programs that are installed in your computer and you can just look around

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,550
在这里，你可以看到，好像你知道有一个日历，一个计算器，一些办公软件。
here you can see like you know there's a calendar a calculator some office software.

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,750
你可以继续向下滚动，那里有很多东西。
You can keep scrolling down and there's loads of things.

34
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,540
例如，Firefox Web浏览器、音乐播放器等等。
For example the Firefox web browser a music player and so on and so on.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,810
就像你知道的，我鼓励你们看看这些东西，看看它们是怎么回事。
And like you know I encourage you to have a look at these and see what they do.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,630
这就是您可以浏览计算机上的文件和诸如此类的内容的方式。
And this is how you can explore the files that are on your computer and things like that.

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:30,500
但是如果你向下滚动或者点击这里的第二个按钮，你会在这里看到一个叫做
But if you scroll down or you click this the second button over here you'll see a program here called

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,070
终点站。
terminal.

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,930
另一种方法是，您可以在搜索中进入顶部，只需键入Terminal，它就会
Another way to do it is you could just go at the top here in search and just type terminal and it will

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,810
直接上来吧。
come straight up.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,120
现在，如果您继续点击它。
Now if you just go ahead and click on that.

42
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,620
我们到了。
Here we are.

43
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,360
您的终端窗口已打开。
Your terminal window has opened up.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,010
在这里，我们将输入课程的命令，我们可以最大化终端。
So in here is where we're going to be typing the commands for the course we might maximize the terminal.

45
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,960
我们可以把它改小一点。
We might make it a bit smaller.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,820
你可以在屏幕上移动，等等，顶部有很多不同的选项。
You can move it around the screen and so on and so on there's loads of different options at the top.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,990
例如，您可以打开终端和可以编辑、复制和粘贴的内容。
For example you can open terminals and things you can edit copy and paste.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,860
更改缩放和许多其他东西可以随心所欲地操作它，但它很容易打开
Change the zoom and so many other things play around with it as you wish but it's rather easy to open

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,610
如果您想要像在任何其他图形系统上一样关闭它。
if you want to close it just like you would on any other graphical system.

50
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,240
您只需单击顶部的X即可。
You just click the X at the top there.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,830
好的。
OK.

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,830
这就是你打开和关闭航站楼的方式，这很容易做到，而且只有一次
So that's how you go ahead and open and close the terminal which is rather easy to do and it's Once

53
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,260
你已经做过一两次了，你可能不会忘记。
you've done it once or twice you probably won't forget it.

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,350
但是也有一些键盘快捷键可以让这个过程变得更快。
But there's also some keyboard shortcuts that will make this process a whole lot faster.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,930
例如，如果只想使用键盘打开终端，可以按Ctrl、Alt和
For example if you want to open the terminal using just your keyboard you can press control alt and

56
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,770
字母T，您会发现所有终端都弹出了，如果您想要关闭它
the letter T and you will find that there were all the terminal pops up and if you want to close it

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,330
你只需按下Ctrl+D即可。
you just press control and D.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,360
然后它就消失了。
And it goes away.

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,890
所以你可以看到，如果不控制T和Open的控件D，这会发生得有多快
So you can see how quickly this how quick this might happen you don't control T and Open's control D

60
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,910
然后它就会关闭。
and it shuts.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,470
好的。
OK.

62
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,530
所以你就在这里。
So there you are.

63
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,650
这就是您可以使用图形方法和键盘快捷键打开和关闭终端的方式。
That's how you can open and close the terminal using both graphical methods and keyboard shortcuts.

64
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,420
您已经迈出了很好的第一步，应该开始感觉更像一个Linux专业人员了，因为
You've an excellent first step already and should start feeling a bit more like a Linux pro because

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,390
现在您知道如何实际打开和关闭航站楼了。
now you know how to actually open and close the terminal.

66
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,570
它就像您计算机上的任何其他程序一样。
It's just like any other program on your computer.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,050
它并不可怕，实际上很容易使用，正如我们将在接下来的几个视频中向您展示的那样。
It's not scary and it's actually rather easy to use as we'll show you in the next few videos.

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,120
但这才是你的训练真正开始的地方，在下一个视频中，你将会跑你的第一个
But here's where your training really begins in the next video you're going to be running your first

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,260
终端中的命令。
commands in the terminal.

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,230
相信我，他们真的很棒。
And trust me they're pretty awesome.

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,910
所以，天哪，我会在下一个视频里见到你的。
So for not goodness I'll see you in the next video.
