00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,150
HELLO YOU BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:02,850
Well.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,470
Well you must be feeling super proud of yourself right now right.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,160
You've come so far in this section of the course so to fully celebrate that I wanted to make a video

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,410
and have a quick recap so that you can soak in all the awesome stuff you've learned in the section of

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,110
the course.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,660
So you started off with the very basics and you learned how to open and close the terminal using graphical

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,500
methods and by using And now beloved keyboard shortcuts.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,970
And it was all very strange to you at first but you jumped right in anyway and you started typing and

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,940
using your first commands you saw the date command the Cal command and the echo command.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,490
And you saw how to clear your term history.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,820
We don't want any spies looking at history after all do we.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,270
They we're making progress but it was all kind of weird and you probably weren't too sure of what was

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,410
actually going on when you run a command.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,390
So then you learned the difference between the terminal and the shell.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,480
You learned that the shell is what interprets the commands that you type just like you interpret the

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,730
meanings of words that you read.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,950
And when you understood what commands actually were you learned the general structure of a command.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,070
Learned the commands follow a command name options arguments structure.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,600
OK.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,760
Now because it became clear that although commands follow a similar structure they do vary quite a bit

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,680
in their usage.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,980
They each have their own specific options and use cases and it would be impossible to memorize them

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,480
all.

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,020
So you learned how to look in the Linux manual you learned how the manual was broken up and you saw

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,910
how to search for terms and read the manual pages and how to learn new things for yourself and find

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,170
things as and when you need them rather than having to memorize everything.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,810
So it's like having your own personal search engine for your computer which is pretty incredible in

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,500
my opinion.

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,420
Now then we took our discussion even deeper and you learned that commands can take input a standard

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,760
input and command line arguments and they can get output via standard output and standard error data

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,630
streams.

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,400
So I had to redirect these data streams to wherever you wish and how to pipe together different commands

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290
to build powerful pipelines.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,280
I hope to use the T command and the X Ogg's command for extra pipeline flexibility.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,580
And this really is amazing how far you've come in such a short amount of time.

37
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,880
So I want to make this video to congratulate you on your progress so far so well done you little computer

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,200
genius you now in the next section you're going to learn about navigating the Linux file system and

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,470
you'll also learn some new building blocks to use in your pipelines.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,540
But before that I have a project for you to complete the project will challenge you to build your very

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,210
own Linux command pipeline.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,060
Now it's going to be awesome and it will serve as a badge of honor that you have learned everything

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,170
that we've covered in this section so that you can feel confident moving on now in the next video I'm

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,560
going to be giving you your project brief.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,970
So congratulations once again you're doing amazingly.

46
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,640
And I'll see you there.
