00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,330
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,740
In the last video you learn the difference between the terminal and the shell and you've also seen how

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,650
commands are structured on quite a general level.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,930
We mentioned that commands follow a general structure like command name Vincent options and then some

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,690
inputs.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,870
But like we saw each of the Linux commands is implemented slightly differently and they behave slightly

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,460
differently.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,540
So other than memorizing a jillion different implementations of things how can we actually know how

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,230
to use each of the Linux commands properly.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,080
Well the answer is to use the manual pages known as man pages for sure.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,090
Now Linux comes with an incredible set of manual pages that will detail the workings of pretty much

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,250
everything on the system including commands.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,830
So in this video we're going to be covering how the manual is structured now because the manual is massive.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,500
Having an understanding of the structure behind it is going to make it so much easier to navigate because

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,880
then you'll know not only what is available in the manual but also where to look for it.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,020
So by the end of the video you'll have an understanding of the manual structure and which sections are

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,160
probably going to be most important to you and you'll also have a cool cheat sheet to take away with

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,250
you that pretty much has all the notes and all the all the top information from this video.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,710
That's quite exciting.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,920
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,020
All right so the first thing you need to know when you're looking at the manual structure is that the

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,600
manual is broken up into eight sections and each of these sections deals with a specific type of thing

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,850
that is on your Linux operating system.

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,390
Now the manual is absolutely huge and be just it would be impossible to deal with if it was all just

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,610
in one big lump.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,790
But breaking it up into several sections that makes it a lot easier for you and I to manage and some

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,860
where we're looking.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,530
So we can actually find what we're looking for.

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,030
OK.

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,070
So let's go through each of these eight sections and have a bit of a bit more understanding of what

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,040
they do.

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,560
OK.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,630
So let's start with section number one.

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,070
So section number one is for user commands.

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,180
Now these are commands that can just be run from the shell by any regular user.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,670
You don't need any particular administration privileges or any root privileges to be able to run these

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,880
commands.

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,950
Anyone can use them for things like the date command the command and so on.

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,810
These are the kind of command that would come under user commands and pretty much any command that you'll

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,650
use day to will be in there.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,360
OK.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,490
Section 2 is for system calls.

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,070
Now this is a more advanced section.

44
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,810
So this is this contains programming functions that can be used within an application that you write

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,150
to make calls to the Linux kernel which is a very low level part of the operating system that we'll

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,040
be discussing actually later on in the course.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,880
But unless you're doing some rather advanced stuff that actually plays with the operating system and

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,080
the hardware on your computer you probably won't use Section 2 but it's there and that's what it's for.

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,400
Same kind of goes for Section 3 which is about C library functions.

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,150
Now these are libraries for the C programming language.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,360
And these are functions and libraries that provide interfaces to specific things on your computer such

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,910
as graphical user interfaces or other libraries that you might want to use if you're writing some C

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,010
code that you want to have access to your computer with then that's the kind of stuff that you will

54
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,860
be looking at in the in section 3 but if you're just a regular user like me you probably won't need

55
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,740
to do so.

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,160
Section 4 is devices and special files always got the word special in it.

57
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,240
But this is about how the different device is on your computer are managed.

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,870
So things such as CD drives or things such as random number generators or things such as U.S. ports

59
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,570
and stuff like that.

60
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,830
This is how they're managed and how you can access those using using command lines and things like that.

61
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,470
So anything to do with the device isn't going to be in Section 4.

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,460
Section 5 is an interesting one Section 5 is about file formats and conventions so if you've ever opened

63
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,410
up a file on your computer and just been like whoa what is that.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,900
Looks like an absolute mess.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,010
I have no idea what is going on how can I possibly use this.

66
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,180
That's what Section 5 is for Section 5 is about all the different formats and the conventions of specific

67
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,700
files and on your computer.

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,040
So you know formats for word documents or formats where PDA documents a format for specific configuration

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,300
files if you want to start configuring things on your computer so customizing stuff.

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,500
Section 5 is what you're going to use often because it'll show you how each of the special files works

71
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,900
and how they're structured and which you data structure you can change them.

72
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,220
Right.

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,260
So that Section 5 section 6 is about games.

74
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,150
Any games that are installed on your computer they have their own section and different commands and

75
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,370
so replicable to those sections 7 is more miscellaneous stuff more Uncategorized stuff.

76
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,750
So it's usually stuff like protocols or file systems and information about those.

77
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,390
If you know what they mean then maybe you want to check it out.

78
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,210
If you don't then don't worry about it you'll probably never come across it.

79
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,220
And Section 8 is lilted of all the stuff to do with system administration.

80
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,320
So this is like the reverse of section 1 Section 8 is all the commands that can actually that actually

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,420
require root privileges and administration privileges to be run on your computers this is things like

82
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,780
changing passwords.

83
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,040
This is things like you know really editing important stuff on your computer setting up automation and

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,780
things like that.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,120
Whereas Section 1 the user commands is stuff that anyone can run.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,450
Section 8 requires privileges in order to actually run those functions of those commands.

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,890
OK.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,340
So those are the eight sections.

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,640
And as I say this information with more explanation is actually in the cheat sheet that you can get

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,970
in the resources section so make sure to check that out after this video.

91
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,360
But the main sections that you're actually going to be using Section 1 which is the user commands will

92
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,920
be using that all the time in this course and you will be using it all the time pretty much whenever

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
you use Linux day today.

94
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,220
Section 5 is usually what you use if you want to start editing stuff and configuring things.

95
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,750
You'll get information on how to edit the stuff and what to edit in specific configuration files using

96
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,240
Section 5 and section 8 when you want to set up things like automation or make some rather advanced

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,160
changes to your computer then you'll use Section 8 which is all the System Administration stuff that's

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,880
when you want to do stuff that normal users shouldn't be able to do all the time.

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,160
It's like changing patching other people's passwords and stuff like that creating users for the system

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,860
and things like that.

101
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,370
OK.

102
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,220
So Section 1 Section 5 and section 8 are what you will likely use most often.

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,010
So there we are that's a that's a structure for the manual does take a quick summary of what we've seen

104
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,150
here we've seen the man Linux menus broken up into eight sections and more information about each of

105
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,170
the sections is actually in the cheat sheet that you can find in the resources.

106
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,520
But now that we've got an understanding of each of the sections and we see how the manual is structured

107
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,180
Let's start actually using it.

108
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,530
OK.

109
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,700
So in the next video what we're going to do is we're going to take this information about the those

110
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,510
structures and we're going to see how you can actually search the manual and read the manual pages to

111
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,190
learn how to use new commands.

112
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,850
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
