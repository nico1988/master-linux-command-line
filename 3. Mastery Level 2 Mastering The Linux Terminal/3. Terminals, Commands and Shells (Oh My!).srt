00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,010
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,190
The last video you got stuck right in and use the most powerful tool on the Linux operating system.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,940
But as they say with great power comes great responsibility.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,020
So in order to maximize your control over the Linux operating system you need to get a solid understanding

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,660
of what's going on when you type your commands.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,650
So over the next few videos we're going to be doing a bit of a deep dive on what is actually going on

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,970
when you run your commands and also go into detail on how the commands are structured so that you can

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,530
understand how to use them properly.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,770
Now if you do already have some previous experience but didn't feel as you quite got it or that something

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,590
is missing in your understanding it's very likely that you aren't 100 percent clear on the stuff that

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,560
we're going to be covering in the next few videos.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,530
So this is super important stuff.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,990
Now whether you do have some previous experience or a complete beginner to it I really want you to pay

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,190
your best attention to the topics that we'll be covering in the next few videos because they are so

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,830
critically important to your understanding of the Linux operating system.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,930
And if you do understand what we cover in the next few videos everything you do in Linux will start

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,550
to make a whole lot more sense.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,640
So be very very excited that we're going to clear this stuff up.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,740
Now in this video you're going to learn the difference between commands the terminal and something called

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,520
the shell.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,440
These are very important distinctions that will underpin basically every single thing that you do on

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,150
the command line.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,600
And by the end of this video you'll have understood the difference between the terminal commands and

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,130
the shell and you'll have a much richer and deeper understanding of what is actually going on behind

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,730
the scenes.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,290
When you use the terminal.

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,390
So this is going to be a critically important lecture.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,940
Let's go ahead and get into it.

29
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,250
So what is actually going on when we type a command.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,870
Well to understand this we need to know the difference between a command and something called the shell.

31
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,450
The commands are just text.

32
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,200
But when you press enter the meaning of that text is interpreted by a computer program called the shell.

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:49,880
OK.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,970
So let's take a real world example.

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,140
If we see the word here on the left rasboras on a physical level that word is just the letters are a

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,330
s p b e r r r e s and just like any other word.

37
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,790
If you can't read the language it won't mean much to you.

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,820
Right but if you took this word and you could for example read English then what would happen is you

39
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,800
would you would see that text and you would interpret it for meaning and what might come out is this

40
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,310
fruit.

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,900
Ok you'd see that text and you would match it with this fruit the raspberries.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,160
But there's a process in the middle of interpreting that text into specific meaning and that is the

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,200
job of the shell.

44
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,790
OK.

45
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,690
So to make this a bit clearer let's say you took the word gift.

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,340
OK.

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,240
And you read that word using the English language and the meaning that might come out might be the idea

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,750
of giving someone a present or something on their birthday.

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,920
Ok so you might say you might get this meaning coming out from reading the word gift but instead of

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
reading it in English with an English shell.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,270
So we call it let's say you took exactly the same word gift but this time you read it with a German

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,570
shell.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,820
Now instead of a present coming out the meaning that might come out of that if you read it in German

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,150
would be the poison which is ironically not the best gift but you can see here that the text is exactly

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,750
the same but the meaning that comes out is different depending upon the shell that interpreted it.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,320
OK.

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,860
As another example let's say we took the word smoking smoking if you read that again in an English shell

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,290
the meaning that would come out would be the idea of using a cigarette.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,740
But if you took exactly the same word and in this time passed it through a French shell.

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,030
OK.

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,090
Using the analogy here of human interpretation what would come out would be a tuxedo which is a fancy

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,090
type of clothing.

63
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,540
So you can see here the text can be exactly the same but the shell interprets that text can give it

64
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,510
different meaning and that is exactly the same on your computer.

65
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,790
So what about the terminal that we now understand the difference between a command and the shell.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,070
So what's the terminal for.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,020
Well the terminal is nothing more than just a window into the shell.

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,770
So let's make this a bit easier to understand.

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:07,360
So if I asked you how would you type commands on to your show without opening the terminal Well you

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,080
couldn't write.

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,040
And that's exactly what the terminal is the term that is kind of like the middle piece in between using

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,040
come out in between typing commands and summon them to the shell.

73
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,340
You can't really type commands anywhere unless you've opened a terminal and that's all is what you're

74
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,720
doing is you're typing commands in the terminal and you press enter and then they are submitted to the

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,680
shelves of the terminal is kind of like the middle piece.

76
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,200
OK.

77
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,420
And there are actually different types of shells so different types of shelves just like there were

78
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,060
different types of human languages can actually interpret the same command in different ways.

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,770
But fortunately there is one type of shell which has been which is the most common type which is called

80
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,120
the bash shell.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,710
So if you've ever heard the term bash shell scripting or bash scripting or something like that it means

82
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,750
writing programs and writing scripts that can be read by the bash shell and Linux.

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,660
Most Linux distribution use the bash shell and aboon buntu definitely does by default.

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,480
So that's something to bear in mind that there are different types of shells on Linux.

85
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,650
They can interpret commands in different ways but the most common one is the bash shell.

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,370
So there we are we've got some standardization there.

87
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,530
So to summarize commands a RealAge the text that you type in the terminal and when you press enter that

88
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,420
text is interpreted by the shell.

89
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,360
Now the shell is a program that translates that text into into actions for the computer.

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,270
Now this means that different shells can actually interpret the same text differently which might cause

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,930
some problems but fortunately most Linux machines use the bash shell.

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:41,920
So there is consistency across most machines and as we said as well the terminal is just a window to

93
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,240
the shell it just it's just the middle piece that allows you to type your commands and submit them to

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,930
the shell.

95
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,760
And as a bonus piece of information your commands are actually also case sensitive.

96
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:57,460
So if you type a command in all uppercase if the shell isn't expecting to see that it will probably

97
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,110
give you an error.

98
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,910
So you need to make sure that things are spelled in exactly the correct way.

99
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,820
OK which has the benefits of allowing you to have more more options because slight differences can give

100
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,950
different functionality but it means you have to be really careful on how you actually type your commands

101
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
if you want them to work the way you want them to.

102
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,200
Now what's coming up next is because we're going to spend a lot of the time in this course typing commands

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,770
and submitting them to the shell.

104
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,660
I don't want you to go through this course and just have to memorize loads and loads and loads different

105
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,170
commands just like pretty much every other cause makes you do what you're going to do is we're going

106
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,550
to take a bit of time to understand what commands actually are and how they are structured so that you

107
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,800
can start to see a pattern behind everything you can start to look at the commands as a type of language

108
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,970
rather than just random text on the screen that you've got to memorize.

109
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,120
Now it's likely you'll probably not have been shown this before so this is going to be a complete game

110
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,740
changer in how you actually approach learning the Linux operating system and learning the terminal.

111
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,400
So I really can't wait to show you this it's going to be really really really helpful.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,880
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
