1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,490
Hello you beautiful people know the terminal is a very powerful tool that is designed to allow you to

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,610
issue what is known as commands to your computer.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,470
Now the idea is that the computer will obey these commands.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,610
We hope and make stuff happen as a result.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,160
Now in this video you're going to learn how to issue your first commands which is very exciting but

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,010
as an aside this course is structured so that each section of the course has its own cheat sheet that

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,680
you can grab at the end of the section.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,380
So don't worry about memorizing all the commands or rushing down to take notes to try out the commands

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,500
that I show you in your own virtual machine on your own computer.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,240
And rest assured everything is all jotted down for you in the cheat sheets that you can get at the end

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,530
of each section.

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,870
That's awesome right.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,190
So by the end of this video you will have run a bunch of Linux commands and you'll start to see a pattern

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,920
emerging in how Linux commands work.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,400
So this is going to be a very important lecture it's going to give you that foundation is going to help

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,940
you understand what everything is all about.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,260
So let's go ahead and jump into it.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,920
OK.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,140
So the first thing we're going to want to do is to open up our terminal.

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,350
There was a quick challenge let's see if you can remember how to do that.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Go ahead and see if within about five seconds or so you can open up the terminal.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,180
You can do it using either graphical methods or if you're feeling particularly pro already use the keyboard

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,940
shortcut you learnt in the last video.

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,260
So you've got five seconds.

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,070
Give it a go.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,060
Do you get it.

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,920
Well if so well done you're learning already.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,350
Now I'm going to open up the terminal using the keyboard shortcut which is control alt and T and there's

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,720
actually a mental pop up.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,350
Now I'm going to do it like that for most of the time from now on.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,200
So don't be confused if you see terminal windows popping up all over the place as we go through the

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,330
course I'm just using the keyboard shortcut but to make the text easier to read on the recording I'm

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,630
going to view and click zoom in will make the font just that much larger.

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,090
OK.

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,250
So I should make it a bit easier to read when I type stuff.

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,930
But at our terminal windows open Let's run a fun command called Echo.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,550
Now the echo command just prints out what you give it as an input.

38
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,770
So type with me the following command we're going to type echo.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,310
OK then press space and we're going to type the word Hello.

40
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,940
Now when I press Enter I'm going to say it's the computer.

41
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,350
OK.

42
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,020
Actually run this command.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,570
And when I press Enter we see Hello command to the computer.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
So it's pretty cool.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,530
Let's try that again.

46
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,850
OK.

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,910
We're going to say echo then type echo.

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,120
With a load of oze.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,140
Ok then I get to press enter and what comes back is Echo.

50
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,910
Oh how awesome is that.

51
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,210
It's just like a cave.

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,530
So let's try now with another command called Cal.

53
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,450
So that's echo.

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,550
Let's try another command called Cal and Cao is going to show up a calendar on the screen.

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,190
So if we type cow just like that and press ENTER you can see that we get a calendar for the current

56
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,480
months for the current month with the with today's date also highlighted.

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,210
And now I'm doing this in October 2017 when you're watching this and doing it yourself it may be a very

58
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,530
different month but you get the point you type cow the default behavior is that you get the current

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,340
month with the current day highlighted but that's just the default behavior of the command.

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,020
OK now that makes Linux commands interesting is how you don't have to stick with the default behavior.

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,990
You can actually customize the behavior of commands to exactly what you want them to do.

62
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,020
So for example what if I wanted the calendar not just for the current month but for the current year.

63
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,980
But what I could do first of all I could type cow then 2017 and I can press enter and it's going to

64
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,360
give me the entire calendar for 2017.

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,000
And also it's going to highlight the current date.

66
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,040
That's pretty cool.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,250
And with very little typing We got a lot more result of that.

68
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,660
Right.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
But you can also give it something give each come on something called an option.

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,580
Now one option is something that allows you to customize the behavior of the command.

71
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,520
OK so I could type cow and instead of typing 2017 or I could just type dash y.

72
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,560
Now this would give the cow command the y option.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,940
Now if I press Enter we also get the calendar for 2017 so you can see here cowled Ashwin gave us the

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,530
calendar for 2017.

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,530
Again highlighted with current dates.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,820
So you've just seen two ways that you can customize icons behavior and give it input and you can give

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,230
it options and we're going to be going into a lot more detail about the difference between the two and

78
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,990
how they work.

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,110
But you may be curious at the moment as to what other ways you can customize commands but I'm going

80
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,910
to save that goodness until later at the minute I just want to give you a little bit of a bit of an

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,920
overview of some different commands that you can use on Linux so you can get comfortable with the typing

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,390
and pressing Enter and seeing result come back up on the screen.

83
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,870
OK.

84
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,000
So let's move on and take a look at another one for example.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,710
You can see today's date using the date command.

86
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:58,520
So if we type date and press ENTER we see that we get today's date and time and time zone and year Pop-Pop.

87
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,580
OK so that's pretty cool.

88
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,340
It's quite useful command.

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,650
But at the moment you can see that we've got quite a lot of text not terminal.

90
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,430
Things are starting to get a bit messy.

91
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,010
We can clean that up a bit as well.

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,090
So to do that we can use the clear command if we type clear and press enter.

93
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,860
It's like we just cleaned up workspace and then we are we've removed all the text from the screen now

94
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,060
because the clear command is used so often there's a key there's a keyboard shortcut for it.

95
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,490
OK.

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,340
So if I just type echo and then put blah blah blah and you can see we've got some text come out of the

97
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,350
screen that the computer had blah blah blah but we can also use a keyboard shortcut to clear the screen

98
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,910
and the keyboard shortcut is your best control.

99
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,790
And the letter L.

100
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,520
Now we all would clear the screen and that's the way that I'm going to be doing it because it's a lot

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,420
faster and a lot easier than typing at the clear command every time.

102
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,240
But you feel free you do you just understand that if the terminal is all of a sudden having all its

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,460
text vanished that's what I've done I've just cleared the screen.

104
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,140
OK.

105
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,650
Now we don't have quite a few commands already.

106
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,300
So what if you wanted to enter a command that evented previously without having to type it out again

107
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,080
maybe it was a particularly long command we don't know what you can do is you can hit the up arrow key

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,220
on your keyboard.

109
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,560
So if I press the paroquet we see Echo blah blah blah top's back up if I press up again it's going to

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,280
go clear.

111
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,890
And again with the date again we see a cow and so on.

112
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,500
I guess you can keep pressing up and cycling backwards through the commands that you've already run

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
which is very very useful.

114
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,620
You can also look at your whole command history using what's called the history command.

115
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,820
So if you type history and press ENTER we can see all of our previous commands with the line number

116
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,140
associated with them.

117
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:44,140
For example we can see the line number for our echo command which is the number one let's say that said

118
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,570
that we are the one who was number one and not what you could do.

119
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,620
Instead of having to cycle all the way back up to number one like that.

120
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,200
What I could do is look a tide the exclamation mark and then one.

121
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,900
OK.

122
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,160
So exclamation mark on one.

123
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,630
And you can see that we've run echo Hello.

124
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,160
OK.

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,110
So let's let's have a look again and have a look at our history again.

126
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,200
We see now let's say we want to run echo blah blah blah.

127
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,340
The London flight is eight right.

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,800
So if I press the exclamation mark and press 8 and then press enter we see we get Echo blah blah blah.

129
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,940
So you can see that that's a bit of a shortcut to save you going back through potentially hundreds of

130
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,810
commands that you've run.

131
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,580
And you know you can you can run them a bit easier like that.

132
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,980
OK.

133
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,060
If you want to run the most recent come on that you've done you can just press exclamation mark exclamation

134
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,860
mark.

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,980
And again we see Echo blah blah blah has run again.

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,830
Now this history file can get quite long.

137
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,600
So if you want to clear the history of this it's kind of a two step process.

138
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,490
You can type history and give it the C option.

139
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,330
OK.

140
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,130
Then add a semi-colon then type history and give it to the w option.

141
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,090
OK so what that does is it clears the history and then actually writes those changes and makes them

142
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,700
permanent.

143
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,290
So when we do that and clear the screen and we look at history we can see that all we've got is just

144
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,170
a history quite literally and it's not something for reference for you it's not particularly important

145
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,900
but you've got to in this video if you want to refer back to it.

146
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,640
OK.

147
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,420
Now finally let's say we want to close the terminal.

148
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:16,810
OK.

149
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,430
Well to do that we could of course click the X button at the top right over here.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,440
But you can also type the exit command and make yourself you know just look that much more pro So if

151
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,820
we press exit.

152
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,150
We can see that the terminal has now closed.

153
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:37,190
And also you could of course use the Control D keyboard shortcuts if I press control and D we can see

154
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,750
the terminals also closed as well.

155
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,250
Like I showed you in the last video and that allows you to type commands operate the terminal and also

156
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,660
close it without ever having to take your hands off the keyboard.

157
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,980
So there you have it you jump right in and I've now ran a whole bunch of Linux commands inside the terminal

158
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,790
so well done.

159
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,260
You've got your feet wet and we're moving as I mentioned to you you can get a cheat sheet which covers

160
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,370
all of the commands that we've covered in this video and all the other commands that we're going to

161
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,000
cover in this section of the course.

162
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,780
At the conclusion lecture of this section but the use case of these commands that we've covered in this

163
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,140
lecture may not be completely clear at this point.

164
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,250
And that's OK.

165
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,030
I wasn't trying to teach you all like a whole bunch of commands in one video.

166
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,540
What I wanted to get across in this video is that commands are executed by typing some weird text in

167
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,930
the terminal and pressing the enter key.

168
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,230
You've also seen that commands can be they can do a whole lot of different things and they can also

169
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,520
be customized for different behavior but they all seem to follow a semi similar kind of structure.

170
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,520
You type some text maybe you got some options maybe some input and you press enter.

171
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,100
Now being able to understand that structure is of incredible importance to mastering the Linux operating

172
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,610
system and leveraging the power of the terminal.

173
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,390
So the next video I'm going to show you how commands are structured in Linux and what we're going to

174
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,190
cover next will serve as a critical foundation for pretty much everything that we're going to learn

175
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,290
going forward and pretty much everything that you ever learn when you're using Linux if you use Linux

176
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,230
before but never really felt as though you've you know you got it or you felt that some stuff was missing

177
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,520
in your understanding it's probably because you weren't shown what I'm about to show you next.

178
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,020
And if you're new to Linux this is going to be the best place to start to make sure that everything

179
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,920
goes smoothly and you start to see the pattern of how the Linux operating system and the commands are

180
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,940
designed rather than just memorizing a massive list.

181
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,420
So for that super important stuff I'll see you in the next video.
