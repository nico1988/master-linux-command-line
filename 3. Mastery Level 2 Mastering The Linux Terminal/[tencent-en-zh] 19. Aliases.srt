00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,460
你们好，漂亮的人们在上一个视频的末尾，我给了你们一些东西的预告
Hello you beautiful people at the end of the last video I gave you a little bit of a teaser about something

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,160
称为别名。
called aliases.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,990
别名基本上是命令或构成命令的命令管道的小昵称
Aliases are basically little nicknames for your commands or for your command pipelines that make them

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,480
好记多了。
a lot easier to remember.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,460
现在，在本视频中，您将学习如何创建自己的命令别名。
Now in this video you're going to be learning how to create your very own command aliases.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,340
太令人兴奋了。
So very exciting.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,250
现在，在这段视频中，我将一步一步地向您介绍。
Now in this video I'm going to walk you through step by step.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,530
创建您自己的命令别名所需的一切。
Everything you need to do to create your own command aliases.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,080
在视频结束时，您应该具备所需的所有技能，以便轻松创建
And by the end of the video you should have all the skills that you need in order to create easy to

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,250
记住管道的昵称，这样一旦你写好了它们，不管它们有多复杂
remember nicknames for your pipelines so that once you've written them no matter how complicated they

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,620
您是否可以一遍又一遍地使用它们，而不需要全部键入，而只需使用
are you can just use them over and over and over again without typing them all out just using instead

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,790
容易记住的昵称。
the easy to remember nicknames.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,560
所以这是超级酷的东西。
So this is super cool stuff.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,420
让我们继续前进，直接投入其中。
And let's go ahead and jump right into it.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,110
好的。
OK.

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,750
因此，要开始创建您自己的命令别名，您需要做的第一件事是创建一个特殊的
So the first thing you need to do to start creating your own command aliases is to create a special

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,720
主文件夹中名为bash aliases的文件。
file called bash aliases in your home folder.

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:03,020
因此，要创建该文件，我们要做的是单击左上角的活动，然后
So to do that to create the file what we want to do is want to click on activities at the top left and

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,400
然后在这里的搜索栏中，只需键入单词text，它应该会出现这里显示的内容
then in the search bar here just type the word text and it should come up with the thing that says Here

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,590
文本编辑器。
text editor.

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,850
只需点击它，它就会打开一个新窗口，在那里我们实际上已经有了一个文件。
Just click on that and it will open up a new window where we've actually got a file.

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,580
这里顶部有一个按钮，您可以点击上面写着“保存”的按钮。
Now there's a button at the top here where you can click that says save.

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,500
所以我要单击保存，然后在我的主文件夹中键入一个文件，该文件开始于它所需的位置
So I'm going to click save and in my home folder I'm going to type a file that starts that it needs

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,150
完全按照我要告诉你的方式拼写。
to be spelled exactly the way that I'm going to tell you.

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,700
好的。
OK.

26
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,470
因此，首先您要键入句号或句号。
So first of all you type a period or full stop.

27
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,320
好的。
OK.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,980
然后键入bash B。
Then you type bash B.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,800
全部用小写字母表示。
SH all in lowercase.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:43,060
然后是下划线，然后是别名，所以L R A S E S。
Then an underscore then aliases so a L R A S E S.

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,470
好的，这就是bash，在别名下划线，开头加句点或句号。
OK so that's bash underscore alias's with a period or full stop at the beginning.

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,880
所有内容均为小写，然后继续并点击保存。
Everything in lowercase and then go ahead and hit save.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,460
好的。
OK.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,700
现在我们有了bash别名的文件。
So now we have our bash alias's file.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,850
实际上，我认为我们一刻也不需要航站楼，所以我也要关闭它。
And actually I don't think for a minute we'll need the terminals so I'm going to close that as well.

36
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,440
好的。
OK.

37
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,090
因此，请确保其拼写与显示完全相同。
So make sure it is spelt exactly as is appear.

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:10,570
句号，然后bash加下划线，别名为al-Ali，a，S.C.S，全部为小写。
Full stop then bash underscore aliases a Al-Ali a s.c.s everything in lowercase.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,710
一旦你拿到了，我们应该都可以走了。
Once you've got the we should be all good to go.

40
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,040
所以现在您可能会想，为什么我们实际上需要在文件开头加上句号来命名该文件。
So now you might be wondering why did we actually need to name the file with a full stop at the beginning.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,090
这很奇怪，我们通常不会这样命名文件，不是吗？
That's quite strange we don't normally name files like that do we.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,600
句号使文件成为一种特殊类型的文件，称为隐藏文件。
Well that full stop makes the file a special type of file called a hidden file.

43
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,620
如果我们回到这里的文件浏览器，查看我们的主文件夹，您会看到bash
So if we go back into the file browser here and we look in our home folder you'll see that the bash

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,560
别名的文件实际上并不在那里。
alias's file isn't actually there.

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,850
它到哪里去了。
Where has it gone.

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,470
这是个隐藏文件。
Well it's a hidden file.

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,350
它有点隐蔽，但如果你点击这里的这个按钮，这里有三个栏，那么它的实际位置是什么
So it's kind of hidden but where it actually is if you click on this button here with the three bars

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,870
如果您单击该选项，然后单击此处，将会出现一个复选框，显示隐藏文件。
if you click that and then click on down here there'll be a checkbox that says show hidden files.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,180
如果我们检查，我们将能够看到已经创建了abash别名Fall。
If we check that we'll be able to see that abash aliases fall has been created.

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,650
但实际上，这里还有很多我们以前从未见过的其他大量隐藏文件。
But there are actually also plenty of other plenty of other hidden files here that we haven't seen before.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,290
但这里是我们的bash别名文件，我们当前正在编辑该文件，甚至还有一些
But here we are here's our bash alias's file that we're currently editing as well as actually even some

52
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,770
可能您甚至不知道的隐藏文件夹正在您的系统中潜伏。
hidden folders that maybe you didn't even know were sneaking around your system.

53
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,330
但不管怎样，我们不需要担心那些狂热分子，只要继续点击这三个栏就行了
But anyway we don't need to worry about those fanatics just go ahead and click those three bars again

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,600
并撤消查看隐藏文件，使其再次消失。
and undo viewing hidden files so it all disappears again.

55
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,790
所以你知道我们不必继续看床下的怪物了，现在我们可以继续
So you know we don't have to continue looking at monsters under our bed and now we can go ahead and

56
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:30,290
实际上，我们一直在编辑bash别名文件，一个案例，另一个案例，我们在bash别名文件中创建
actually keep editing the bash aliases file a case and another we're in bash aliases file making an

57
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,650
别名实际上非常简单。
alias is actually really quite easy.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,960
下面是我们要为其创建别名的命令。
So here's the command that we want to make an alias for.

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,100
这将是一个非常长的命令，里面有很多复杂的东西。
It's going to be a really long command with loads of complicated stuff in it.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,700
但是我们可以做到的。
But we can do this.

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,420
这不是什么新鲜事，只是相当复杂，相当长，所以我们可以把日期打出来。
It's not there's nothing new it's just quite complex it's quite long so we're going can type the date

62
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,240
指挥部。
command.

63
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,460
我们要把它传递给指挥部。
We're going to pass that into the command.

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,810
我们已经见过无数次了。
We've seen this a jillion times right.

65
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,850
我们假设分隔符是空格，我们将获得第一个字段。
We're going to take that the delimiter is a space and we're going to get the first field.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,590
好的。
OK.

67
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,620
现在我们也想要一份这些数据的副本。
Now we were also wanted to have a copy of that data.

68
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:06,800
我们想要拍摄快照，这样我们就可以使用T命令并将其保存在主文件夹中名为的文件中
We want to take a snapshot so we can take the T command and save that in a file in our home folder called

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,200
完整日期。
full date.

70
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:17,090
前州立大学博士好的，到目前为止我们做得很好，那么我们就来拍一张这一天的快照
Dr. ex-state Okay so we're doing well so far then we're going to take a snapshot of just the day of

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,830
这周。
the week.

72
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,640
我们将把它保存在主文件夹中的一个名为“短期策略”的文件中。
We're going to save that in our home folder in a file called short date tactics.

73
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,030
然后输出的所有内容都将传递到echo命令，但也会给出回声
And then everything that comes out we're going to pass into the echo command but also give the echo

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,700
掌握自己的论据。
command its own argument.

75
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,090
这是一个相当长的评论。
That's quite a long comment.

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,590
正确的。
Right.

77
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,180
所以我们在这里做了很多事情。
So we're doing a lot of stuff in here.

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,170
但问题是它很长，因为您可以看到别名是多么有用。
But the point is that it's long because you can see how useful alias's are right.

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
因此，让它在您的计算机上运行的唯一方法就是不让Ziyad做得很好，除非在
So the only thing to make it work for your computer is instead of having Ziyad Well unless in the one

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,570
极有可能您的名字也是Ziyad，并且您选择它作为您的虚拟服务器上的用户名
in a jillion chance that your name is also Ziyad and you chose it to be your user name on your virtual

81
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,570
我认为不太可能的机器。
machine which I think is unlikely.

82
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:03,350
但是，如果您是半消息用户，而不是其他用户，请继续使用您的用户名进行更改，以便
But if you are semi message but otherwise just go ahead and change that with your username so that it

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,280
匹配您计算机上的正确路径，否则您将开始收到如我所说的错误
matches the correct path on your computer otherwise you're going to start getting errors like I said

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,850
如果你，如果你的用户名是你知道的，萨利，只要把它改成我就行了。
if you if your username was you know Saly just change it to me.

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,920
莎莉，好的，但是我的是齐亚德，所以我就不说了。
Sally OK but mine was Ziyad so I'll keep it at that.

86
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,450
好的。
OK.

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,480
这就是我们想要的命令。
So this is the command that we want.

88
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,540
我们给它取个别名吧。
Let's make an alias for it.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,350
比方说，我们想要这样做，而不是每次想要时都键入这个庞大的命令
Let's say for example we wanted to instead of typing out this massive command every time we wanted to

90
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,970
去做吧，而不是简单地把它打出来。
do it instead of just typing it out.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,250
如果我们只想输入GET DATES(获取日期)，而它将是Alias，该怎么办？
What if we wanted to just type get dates and that was going to be Alias.

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,120
我们所要做的就是键入单词alias，这是一个特殊的单词，然后按空格键，然后获取
What all we have to do is just type the word alias which is a special word then press a space then get

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,530
日期为等号，然后两边各有一个撇号，来吧，所以您可以看到有一个
dates an equal sign and then an apostrophe on either side of that come on so you can see there's an

94
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,580
这里有撇号。
apostrophe here.

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
这里有一个撇号。
And there's an apostrophe here.

96
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,820
好的。
OK.

97
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,080
就像整个庞大命令的两边各有一个引号，然后在开头加上别名。
So like a single quote on either side of the whole massive command then alias at the beginning.

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,950
别名的名称用等号加引号，然后在MASK命令的两侧用引号引起来。
The name of the alias an equal sign and then quotes on either side of the massive command.

99
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,640
所以我们要说的是，嘿，我想做一个别名叫Get Dates。
So what we're saying is hey I want to make an alias called get dates.

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,910
这完全等同于这个命令。
That is exactly equal to this command.

101
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,940
现在，当我们保存并关闭它时。
Now when we save it and close it.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,470
所以我们需要关闭编辑器，然后单击这里的这三个栏。
So we need to close the the editor so we go with click on these three these three bars over here.

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,340
单击关闭确定，然后单击关闭。
Click Close OK and close.

104
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,720
我认为，所有这些都是大体上的，只是把它往下拖，然后关闭。
All of this in general I think and just drag that down and close.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,820
当我们在一号航站楼打开的时候，我们重新启动了我们的终端，这个别名应该已经加载好了，所以我想让你
And when we open at terminal one we reboot our terminal that alias should be loaded OK so I want you

106
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,160
把这些别名看作是你自己的命令。
to think of these alias's as being like your own commands.

107
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,640
好的。
OK.

108
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,650
所以如果我们尝试运行get date命令，我们应该称之为。
So if we try and run the get dates commands shall we call it.

109
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,100
如果我们继续按Enter键，记住get date是我们的别名，实际上
And if we go ahead and press ENTER remembering that get dates was the name of our alias we actually

110
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,010
获取一些输出。
get some output.

111
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,970
所以这很酷。
So that's pretty cool.

112
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:01,320
现在，如果我们继续查看主文件夹中的，我们还会看到已经创建了两个新文件
Now if we go ahead and look in our in our home folder we'll also see that two new files have been created

113
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,440
转换为全日期点文本和短日期点文本。
to full date dot text and short date dot text.

114
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,750
那么让我们继续查看一下文本的日期。
So let's go ahead and take a look in for date that text.

115
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,530
我们实际上已经走了，拿到了完整的日期。
We've actually gone and got the full date.

116
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,120
所有数据都已传入，并确定DOT采取的日期。
All the data has been passed into that and sure date DOT takes.

117
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,590
他刚刚度过的一周中的某一天并不令人敬畏。
He has had just the day of the week passed in is not awesome.

118
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,940
好的。
OK.

119
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,950
因为这来自别名(如果我删除这些别名并继续运行以获取再次开始的日期)
Because this has come from the alias if I delete those and go ahead and run to get dates come on again

120
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,870
我们看到文件已经创建。
we see that the files have been created.

121
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,280
再来一次，里面有相同的数据。
One more time with the same data in them.

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,750
所以这太酷了，对吧。
So this is super cool right.

123
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,600
比方说，与其打出那么长的别名真的真的不会来
Like instead of typing out that really really really long Aliase really really don't come and every

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,970
现在我们想要获得该功能，因为我们已经创建了一个别名，并且基本上给出了一个可爱的昵称
time we wanted to get that functionality because we've created an alias and basically given a cute nickname

125
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,970
命令get date而不是庞大的管道，我们现在可以获得相同的功能，但是在
to the command get dates instead of the massive pipeline we can now get the same functionality but in

126
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,440
一种更容易记忆的方式，也是一种实际上很容易复制的方式。
a much easier to remember way and the way that's actually easy to reproduce.

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,650
所以这真的很棒。
So that's really awesome.

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,530
但现在让我给你看一些超级酷的东西。
But now let me show you something super cool.

129
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,080
好的。
OK.

130
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,380
实际上，您还可以在更大的管道中使用别名。
You can actually also use aliases in bigger pipelines.

131
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,680
因此，可以将您的别名看作是它自己的管道。
So think of your aliases just being its own pipeline right.

132
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,250
如果您别名(如果您保存的最小管道可以接受标准输入)中的第一个命令
If your alias if that mini pipeline that you save can accept standard input if the first command in

133
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,810
它可以接受标准输入，然后您可以通过管道连接到别名并运行整个管道，然后
it can accept standard input then you can just pipe to the alias and run the whole pipeline and then

134
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,520
摆脱别名，继续下去，就像有了自己的小管道建设挡路一样。
pipe out of the alias and continue on it's like having your own little pipeline building block.

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,540
所以让我带你去看看好的。
So let me show you OK.

136
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,000
假设我们希望我们的命令有一个别名，该别名显示一个月前的日历
Let's say that we wanted to have an alias for our command that showed a calendar with one month before

137
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,330
在当月之后的一个月，所以这个月的骗局就是奶牛。
and one month after the current month so that the con for that would be cow.

138
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,970
那么一就是一。
Then a one be one.

139
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,660
好的，那么在一个月之前的一个月之后，我们得到当前的月份，在我一个月之后得到一个月
OK so after one month before one month and we get the current month with one month after I'm one month

140
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,810
在此案之前，这是命令。
before the case that's the command.

141
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:51,260
如果我们返回到这里，请单击这三个水平箭头、水平条、抱歉并显示隐藏
If we go and head back in here click these three horizontal arrows horizontal bars sorry and show hidden

142
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,160
文件。
files.

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,260
单击我们的bash别名文件，打开并转到文件中的新行。
Click on our bash aliases files open up and go onto a new line in the file.

144
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,530
让我们为该命令创建一个新别名。
Let's create a new alias for that command.

145
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,150
好的，我们要说。
OK so we're going to say.

146
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,070
我们将把魔术简称为日历魔术。
We're going to call magic short for calendar magic.

147
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,940
我要输入一个等号，然后你就可以输入一些语音符号了。
I'm going to type an equal sign and then you can actually type some speech marks.

148
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,850
好的，你不必用单引号。
OK you don't have to have the single quotes.

149
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,780
你也可以有言语痕迹。
You can have speech marks as well.

150
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,590
我要把那头牛打出来。
I'm going to type that cow.

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
然后是选项。
Then the option.

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,110
给我吧。
Give it.

153
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,880
第一个是它自己的论点，然后是B。
Number one is its own argument then a B.

154
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,580
大写B，那么就有了自己的论点。
Capital B then one has its own argument.

155
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,690
我们将输出到我的主目录中一个名为Thing Dotty XTi的文件中，当然，请记住
And we're going to output into a file in my home directory called Thing Dotty XTi And of course remember

156
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,090
将此位替换为您在虚拟机上使用的用户名。
to replace this bit with your user name that you're using on your virtual machine.

157
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,980
好的，我们称之为魔术。
OK so we're going to call that magic.

158
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,680
但是这里的母牛指挥。
But the cow command here.

159
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,140
正确的。
Right.

160
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,820
COW命令只接受命令行参数，默认情况下不能通过管道传递给CALL命令。
The cow command only accepts command line arguments you can't piped to the call command by default.

161
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,080
所以要使它成为有效的管道，你可以访问整个Cal神奇的东西，一个有效的管道
So to make this a valid pipeline that you can access this this whole Cal magic thing a valid pipeline

162
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,780
你可以用管子送到那里。
that you can pipe to.

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,660
我们实际上需要将XOGS命令放在开头。
We need to actually put the X OGs command at the beginning.

164
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,230
好的。
OK.

165
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,890
所以我们就这么做吧。
So let's just do that.

166
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,820
如果你不知道我现在在做什么，请耐心等我，好吗？这是在做一座挡路大楼
If you don't know what I'm doing at the minute just bear with me OK which is making a building block

167
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,170
这整件事是我们可以用管道连接的。
this whole thing that we can pipe to.

168
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,670
好的。
OK.

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,920
所以这就是我们现在所做的，无论是什么，都将被输送到牛的魔术中，实际上
So that's what we've done right there now whatever is going to be piped to cow magic will actually be

170
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,070
通过管道传输到X Ogg的命令，然后将数据从标准输入转换为Cal不能转换的数据
piped to the X Ogg's command which will then convert the data from standard input which Cal doesn't

171
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,010
除了COW接受的命令行参数。
except to command line arguments which cow does accept.

172
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,080
因此，整个管道都会正常工作。
And so therefore the whole pipeline will work.

173
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,970
一定会很棒的。
It's going to be awesome.

174
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,510
相信我就好。
Just trust me.

175
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,080
好的。
OK.

176
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,270
让我们继续这样做，让我们关闭那个，保存并关闭关闭，关闭所有东西并关闭
Let's go ahead and do this let's close that save and close the close the close everything and close

177
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,910
我们的终端并重启它。
our terminal and reboot it.

178
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,190
新闻控制人员Alt和T谈论了九号航站楼。
The press control alt and t talked about terminal nine.

179
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:50,210
我呼应12 20：17进入考瓦尔魔术，接下来会发生的是，我将以命令的形式呼应这些数据
I echo 12 20:17 into Cowal magic what's going to happen is I'm going to be echoing this data as command

180
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,190
将参数行到MAGIC命令。
line arguments to the magic command.

181
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:59,800
所以我们预计会发生的是，我们预计我们会在2017年12月
So what we're expecting to happen is that we're expecting that we're going to get December 2017 the

182
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,890
日历上有前后各一个月的日历。
calendar for it with a month before and a month after.

183
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,670
好的。
OK.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,160
保存到主目录中的文件。
Save to a file in our home directory.

185
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,290
所以如果我按Enter键，我们不会得到任何输出。
So if I press Enter we don't get any output.

186
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:18,480
但是如果我们进入这里的文件，我们会看到这里有一个文件，叫做Things That Take。
But if we go into our files here we will see that there is a file in here called things that takes take.

187
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:24,140
我们实际上已经设法保存了一个月前一个月和一个月前2017年12月的日历
We've actually managed to save the calendars for December so December 2017 one month before and one

188
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,900
一个月后，我们的家庭文件夹里出现了一种叫做“Take t”的东西。
month after into a fall called things that takes t in our home folder.

189
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,780
如果我真的得到了这些隐藏文件，那么发生这种情况的原因可能会容易得多。
And the reason that happened is probably a lot easier to see if I actually get one of these hidden files.

190
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,060
不，不。
No no.

191
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,090
我会的，我会留着它们，否则我会失去我现在的位置
I will I will keep them because otherwise I'll lose where I am.

192
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:46,050
但发生的情况是，我们重复了我们基本上传递给ex ogs命令的情况。
But what happened is we echoed we basically passed to the ex OGs command.

193
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,560
12点和20点17分的两条信息，然后作为命令行参数提供给日历
Two pieces of information at 12 and 20:17 which were then given as command line arguments to the calendar

194
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,440
指挥部。
command.

195
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,380
所以你可以看到所有这些东西是如何开始连接在一起的，我们已经制作了一条迷你管道，名为
So you can see how all this stuff is starting to tie together and we've made a mini pipeline called

196
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,930
Cowe Magic现在可以在我们想要的任何时候运行命令，所以我们不必键入以下内容
cowe magic that will now be able to run a command whenever we want so we don't have to type out this

197
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,630
丑陋的事情，我们只需要知道有多神奇，因为我们让第一个命令成为可能
ugly thing we just have to know how magic and because we made it possible to pipe to the first command

198
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,570
在我们的别名中，整个管道都会工作，我们可以在任何程序中像迷你建筑挡路一样使用它
in our alias the whole pipeline will work and we can use it like a mini building block in whatever programs

199
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,980
我们想做的东西。
that we want to make.

200
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,260
那么，这是多么令人敬畏的权利。
So how awesome is that right.

201
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,820
您能看到为管道编写别名并在中使用这些别名的能力有多么强大吗？
Can you see how crazily powerful the ability to write alias's for pipelines and use those aliases in

202
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,880
管道实际上可能是正确的。
the pipelines can actually be right.

203
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,940
你用这种能力所能达到的可能性真的是无穷无尽的。
The possibilities really are limitless with what you can achieve with that ability.

204
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,620
所以我们就把它留在这里吧。
So let's just leave it there.

205
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,270
我会让你的头脑因此而大吃一惊。
I'm going to leave your mind blown with that.

206
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,210
继续，现在总结一下我们所了解的关于别名的知识。
Go ahead and now take a summary of what we've learned about alias's.

207
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,300
好了，现在脑筋急转弯就到此为止了。
OK so that's enough of being mind blowing for now.

208
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,920
我希望你和我一样对你在这段视频中学到的东西感到兴奋，那就是锯齿混叠绝对是一种
I hope you're as excited as I am by what you've learned in this video that aliasing aliasing is an absolutely

209
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,190
令人难以置信的能力，如果使用得当，具有真正无限的潜力。
incredible ability with really limitless potential if used in the right way.

210
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,010
所以让我们快速回顾一下，以确保你们都记下来了。
So let's just have a quick recap to make sure that you've got it all down.

211
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,880
所以在这段视频中，首先你会了解到别名基本上就是一个容易记住的昵称
So in this video first of all you learn that an alias is basically just an easy to remember nickname

212
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,550
用于在管道中连接在一起的一个命令或一系列命令。
for a command or series of commands joined together in a pipeline.

213
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:12,770
现在，要创建别名，首先需要有一个名为点划线、下划线别名或小写的文件
Now to create an alias you need to first have a file called dot dash underscore aliases or in lowercase

214
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,810
在您的主文件夹中。
in your home folder.

215
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,000
这就是您实际放置数据文件的位置，您实际将别名和这些别名放在其中
And that's where you actually put your data file that you actually put your aliases in and these aliases

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,530
因此将特定于您的用户。
therefore will be specific to your user.

217
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,050
现在，作为一个加分点，您可以学习文件名开头的句号、句号或圆点
Now as a bonus point you learn a period or full stop or a dot at the start of a file name makes that

218
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,350
文件隐藏。
file hidden.

219
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:38,040
您还了解了如何在文件查看器中打开或关闭隐藏文件的可见性。
So and you also saw how to turn on or off the visibility of hidden files in your file viewer.

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,800
好的。
OK.

221
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,580
现在位于bash别名文件中。
Now inside the bash aliases file.

222
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,710
所以这实际上很容易做一个别名。
So that is actually quite easy to make an alias.

223
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:43,910
正确的。
Right.

224
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,310
这是您先输入关键字别名(全部小写)的方法。
This is the way that you do it first you type the key word alias all in lowercase.

225
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,010
然后放一个空格，然后放上别名。
Then you put a space and then you put the alias name.

226
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,870
所以当我们有了约会，或者它被称为魔术，或者随便你怎么称呼它，那就是你的昵称。
So as we get dates or it was call magic or whatever you want to call it that's your nickname.

227
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,310
好的。
OK.

228
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,630
然后在别名和等号之间加一个等号，而不添加空格
Then you put an equal sign without adding a space with space at all between the alias and the equal

229
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,080
你放进去的签名。
sign you put in.

230
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,140
所以你只要立即画一个等号就行了。
So you just put an equal sign immediately.

231
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,640
然后你打开一些报价。
Then you open some quotes.

232
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,230
这些引号可以是使用撇号的单引号，也可以是像您这样的普通双引号
These quotes can be either single quotes using an apostrophe or you know normal double quotes like you

233
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,830
将再次用于语音标记，没有任何空格，没有任何空隙。
would use for speech marks again without any spaces without any gaps.

234
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,140
在等号之间，您只需创建您的管道或使用您的命令。
Between the equal sign then you just create your pipeline or you use your command.

235
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,670
同样，你可以像往常一样选择和指挥一夫一妻制。
Again you can have options and command monogamists just like you normally would.

236
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,520
好的，你想吃多久就吃多久。
OK these can go on for as long as you want.

237
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,970
好的。
OK.

238
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:37,180
现在，只要确保重新启动终端，您就可以永远访问该别名。
Now as long as you make sure that you restart your terminal you'll then have access to that alias forever.

239
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,810
好的。
OK.

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,230
而作为另一个加分点看你看，你得到的两个加分点在总结中应该是应该的
And as another bonus point looking you look you get two bonus points in the summary should be should

241
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,390
感到被宠坏了。
be feel very spoiled.

242
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,090
但是，只要您确保该管道中别名中的第一个命令实际上可以通过管道传输
But as long as you make sure the first command in that alias in that pipeline can actually be piped

243
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:57,530
要确定，您只需通过管道将别名教皇连接到昵称，您就可以像通过管道连接到
to OK then you can just pipe to the alias pope to the nickname and you'll it as if you're piping to

244
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,840
整条管道。
the whole pipeline.

245
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,870
如果我再说一次烟斗这个词，我可能会发疯的。
If I say the word pipe one more time I'm probably going to go insane.

246
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,220
但是你说对了。
But you get the point right.

247
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:13,460
如果使您的管道可以通过使用X OGS命令或仅使用
If you make it so that your pipeline can be piped to either by using the X OGs command or by just using

248
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,950
一个可以接受标准输入的普通命令，那么您基本上可以使用
a normal command that can accept standard input then instead of having to you can basically use the

249
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,790
将许多管道别名为正在建设某一大型其他管道中的一座小建筑挡路
alias that many pipeline as a tiny building block in some massive other pipeline that you're building

250
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,810
创造出真正史诗般的功能。
to create a really epic bit of functionality.

251
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,900
好的，根据您所学到的管道、X参数和所有类型的内容，以正确的方式使用别名
OK so alias is used in the right way with what you've learnt about piping and X args and all sorts of

252
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,620
制造这些长管道的材料是一种史诗般的能力。
stuff making these long pipelines is an epic epic ability.

253
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,500
因此，现在您可以构建自己的命令管道，甚至可以保存它们以备以后理解时使用
So now you can build your own command pipelines and even save them for use later when you understand

254
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,620
基本上Linux操作系统中的任何东西都可以使用命令行进行修改。
that basically anything in the Linux operating system can be modified using command line.

255
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,690
你真的是让Linux操作系统如此令人惊叹的皇冠上的明珠，因为任何东西都可以
You really are the crown jewel that makes the Linux operating system so amazing because anything can

256
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,170
使用命令行进行编辑。
be edited using the command line.

257
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,940
您知道，必须创建这些命令来说明如何使用这些命令，并将它们通过管道连接在一起来完成
And you know had to create these come on how to use these commands and piped them all together to do

258
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,340
你想要什么都行。
whatever you want.

259
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,680
您真的拥有一个万能钥匙，可以将您的计算提升到一个新的水平。
You've really got a master key that take your computing to the next level.

260
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,970
但是要利用这一点，你现在所需要的只是简单的积木，实际上
But in order to take advantage of this all you need now are just simple building blocks to actually

261
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,890
使用建造管道。
build pipelines with.

262
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,460
正确的。
Right.

263
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,730
所以在课程的下一节中，我们实际上将介绍一大堆这样的建筑
So in the next section of the course we're actually going to be covering a whole bunch of those building

264
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,950
块，因为本课程的下一节将全部介绍导航文件系统创建操作
blocks because the next section of the Course is all about navigating your file system creating manipulating

265
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,400
文件、创建文件夹、复制和粘贴文件、创建系统备份等等。
files making folders copying and pasting files creating backups of your system and so much more.

266
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,640
但在我们谈到这一切之前，我想确保你了解我们所拥有的一切
But before we get into all that goodness I want to make sure that you understand everything that we've

267
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,490
先在课程的这一节讲到，因为这是一个令人难以置信的基础性的、令人难以置信的
covered in this entire section of the course first because it's been an incredibly foundational incredibly

268
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,310

So in the next video we're going to have a celebration of your really impressive progress and a quick

275
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,890
回顾一下我们在这一节所讲的内容。
recap of what we've covered in the section.

276
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,160
