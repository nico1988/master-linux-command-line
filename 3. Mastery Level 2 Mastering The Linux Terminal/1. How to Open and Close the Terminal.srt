00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello you beautiful people know one of the biggest reasons for someone to switch to Linux is to use

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,290
what is arguably the most powerful feature of the Linux operating system and that is the terminal.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,020
Now if you've ever seen a film where a hacker or a computer genius has sat behind their computer typing

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,330
commands into what looks like a big black box on their computer screen that black box is called the

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,170
terminal.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,490
Now at one time the entire Linux operating system was purely terminal based.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,500
But as time has gone on more graphical tools have been developed up until now where we have these beautiful

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,190
desktop environments like what we see on a buntu.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,120
Now fundamentally the main difference between using the terminal and using normal graphical methods

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,310
that you're probably already familiar with from even using a Windows or a Mac is that instead of pointing

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,480
and clicking with the mouse to control your computer you'll be typing with the keyboard instead.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,820
Now Linux is unique in that the development of Linux is inseparable from the terminal.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,370
And this means that knowing how to use the terminal gives you pretty much absolute control over how

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,880
your computer works by using the terminal.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,700
You can do pretty much anything that you want with your Linux computer.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,930
Now you can't get this level of control over your computer in any other operating system.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,080
And this makes the terminal an incredible skill to learn.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,530
Now although it's absolutely awesome I understand that the terminal can be a bit intimidating at first

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,570
so in this video we're going to start off nice and easy and I'm going to show you how you can actually

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,330
open and close the terminal in a buntu.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,710
And by the end of this video you'll have taken a very important first step in your mastery of the Linux

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,280
operating system and you'll also be able to open and close at will.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,220
The most powerful tool that Linux has to offer.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,580
So let's go ahead and get started.

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,390
All right.

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,580
So here we are in a beautiful buntu desktop.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,790
Now I'm going to show you how you can go ahead and open the terminal using graphical methods.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,120
Now down the bottom left here you'll notice a a set of nine dots.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
And if you hover over it says show applications.

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,500
If you click on that it will open up in a rather awesome way.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,460
A whole list of different programs that are installed in your computer and you can just look around

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,550
here you can see like you know there's a calendar a calculator some office software.

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,750
You can keep scrolling down and there's loads of things.

34
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,540
For example the Firefox web browser a music player and so on and so on.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,810
And like you know I encourage you to have a look at these and see what they do.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,630
And this is how you can explore the files that are on your computer and things like that.

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:30,500
But if you scroll down or you click this the second button over here you'll see a program here called

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,070
terminal.

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,930
Another way to do it is you could just go at the top here in search and just type terminal and it will

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,810
come straight up.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,120
Now if you just go ahead and click on that.

42
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,620
Here we are.

43
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,360
Your terminal window has opened up.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,010
So in here is where we're going to be typing the commands for the course we might maximize the terminal.

45
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,960
We might make it a bit smaller.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,820
You can move it around the screen and so on and so on there's loads of different options at the top.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,990
For example you can open terminals and things you can edit copy and paste.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,860
Change the zoom and so many other things play around with it as you wish but it's rather easy to open

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,610
if you want to close it just like you would on any other graphical system.

50
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,240
You just click the X at the top there.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,830
OK.

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,830
So that's how you go ahead and open and close the terminal which is rather easy to do and it's Once

53
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,260
you've done it once or twice you probably won't forget it.

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,350
But there's also some keyboard shortcuts that will make this process a whole lot faster.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,930
For example if you want to open the terminal using just your keyboard you can press control alt and

56
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,770
the letter T and you will find that there were all the terminal pops up and if you want to close it

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,330
you just press control and D.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,360
And it goes away.

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,890
So you can see how quickly this how quick this might happen you don't control T and Open's control D

60
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,910
and it shuts.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,470
OK.

62
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,530
So there you are.

63
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,650
That's how you can open and close the terminal using both graphical methods and keyboard shortcuts.

64
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,420
You've an excellent first step already and should start feeling a bit more like a Linux pro because

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,390
now you know how to actually open and close the terminal.

66
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,570
It's just like any other program on your computer.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,050
It's not scary and it's actually rather easy to use as we'll show you in the next few videos.

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,120
But here's where your training really begins in the next video you're going to be running your first

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,260
commands in the terminal.

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,230
And trust me they're pretty awesome.

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,910
So for not goodness I'll see you in the next video.
