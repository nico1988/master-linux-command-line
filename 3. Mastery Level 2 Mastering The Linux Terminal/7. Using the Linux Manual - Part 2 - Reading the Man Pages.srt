00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,980
Hello you beautiful people know in the last video you learned about the structure of the intox manual

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,850
and you saw the way that it was broken up into eight sections.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,080
And those eight seconds each deal with a different part of the Linux experience.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,250
Now we're going to take that theory from the last video and we're going to turn it into practice.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,080
In this video.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,600
So in this video you can learn how to search the minute and discover new commands and how to access

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,550
the manual pages for those commands.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,800
And you're also going to learn how to read them so that you can go out there and independently learn

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,360
how to use new stuff.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,930
So by the end of this video you'll have the independence to search for new commands and learn about

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,610
how they work.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,610
And this is going to put you in the driver's seat because it makes it possible for you to gain more

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,780
control of your Linux system because you can start learning independently about how everything works

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,490
rather than waiting for a random chances that you randomly bump into learning new commands.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,440
You can take a lot more of an active role in your learning and your development of the Linux operating

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,030
system.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,420
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,480
OK so now that you know that the manual is broken up into eight sections How would you know what section

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,370
to look in to find what you're looking for.

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,730
Well let's say that you wanted to look up information about the which command first to search the manual

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,680
you would have to use the man command that a man command is short for the word manual.

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,370
And it's the command that deals with everything to do with the manual basically.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,890
And this is why they're actually called man pages because it's the man command that looks through the

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,350
manual.

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:25,880
OK.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,590
Now that's the command name.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,370
So we're good at that.

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,890
Now we need to give it any options if necessary.

29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,630
Mark are you going to use the k option which is what deals with searching.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,130
OK so we've got some unnamed options now.

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,180
It needs an input and the input that we're going to give is the search term.

32
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,600
So we type which.

33
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,110
OK.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,690
So we got a command name we've got our options we've got our inputs the same general structure that

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,320
I was setting up before but now what we're doing actually is using the man come on to search the manual

36
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,620
for this search term the search term here called which.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,490
Is going to look all the way through the manual and find anything that might be relevant to that search

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,670
time.

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,130
It's like your own mini search engine for your manual.

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,600
So if Representer we get quite a few lines of output here.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,950
OK.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,600
So let's let's have a look at what this is on the left here.

43
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,070
You're going to get the names of certain manual pages.

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,480
OK.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,540
Every single one of these is a manual page that is appropriate to this search term.

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,250
OK.

47
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,130
And on the right you get a bit of a synopsis about the actual page so you can pick which one might be

48
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,430
most appropriate.

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,650
OK.

50
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,370
And the other thing is in the parentheses here you get the section number of the manual that that page

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,270
is in.

52
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,690
So for example this command at manual page is in the first section of the manual which means it's a

53
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,630
user command whereas this one is in the 8th section of the manual which means that it is a more system

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,460
administrative kind of thing.

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:03:00,890
And this one is in Section 5 which is going to be a file file configuration how the files are structured

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,840
and things are that information about how files are structured so that we can actually see at a glance

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,530
whether it actually suits our needs or not.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,100
And if we decide that we want to take a further look it seems like this one is exactly what we're looking

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,020
forward to the use a command section and it's a command that locates a command.

60
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,240
We can actually take a deeper look at that by using the map again.

61
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,250
Then the section number.

62
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,760
So the section number is 1 and then we type the search term.

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,070
And so the page name which is on the left there which is which.

64
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,560
OK and if I press enter.

65
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,780
We've opened up the manual page for the which command.

66
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,380
It's only very small and once we've opened that to close it and get back out we just press the q key

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,940
on the on the keyboards or press the letter Q And I'm back on my command line.

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,530
So for example we could open up this small section here this soul thing by doing MAN 6 because it's

69
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,610
Section 6 salt and I press enter and it opens up that that manual page for salt which you can see at

70
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,750
the top right there.

71
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,240
OK.

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,790
Now because the first section of the manual is used so often you don't usually have to type the number

73
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,970
one even so instead of typing Man 1 which is a nice Shoko I can just type the word man.

74
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,880
Can you type man.

75
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,210
Which which will open up the same page the same manual page and you can see that it is indeed in Section

76
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,820
1.

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,380
OK so that's a shortcut if you see that something is in Section 1.

78
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,100
You don't need to talk the one you just type the actual name of the page.

79
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,880
So like a page we've got LCF right.

80
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:41,270
LCF is in section 1 man LCF and we see that we all know in the LCF man page in section 1 which means

81
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,560
that it's a user command.

82
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,020
OK.

83
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,090
So that's how you would open up a manual page.

84
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,050
And up next now we're going to take a look at how you would actually read it.

85
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,660
OK.

86
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,590
So let's take a look at the man page for the which command.

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,770
So I'm going to talk man.

88
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,820
And then which.

89
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,510
And because it's actually a command that I've used very recently I could have just pressed the arrow

90
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,810
key a couple of times and I get back to the same result.

91
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,360
OK.

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,250
So I press man which press enter and we've opened up the manual page.

93
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,230
Now we can see that this manual page is actually broken up into the following sections of the top we've

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,210
got name then we've got a synopsis then we've got a description that we've got options.

95
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,130
Then we've got exit status.

96
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,470
OK now the sections a man page may include all examples.

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,520
See also section an environment section things about Bogues things about office things about reporting

98
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,780
bugs history of the command copyright things.

99
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,400
Stuff like that.

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,360
OK but this is what we get in this specific manual page because they're not always structured the same

101
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,280
way but they usually follow this kind of structure.

102
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:44,780
OK.

103
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,000
Now in the name section we see that we are dealing with the which command and we see a little bit about

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,530
what it does and this is actually what came up when we searched the manual in the first place.

105
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,800
OK this is exactly what came up.

106
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,070
We saw the name and then this little piece of information on the right hand side.

107
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,160
OK.

108
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,710
Now in the description section this is where you this is where you really see what the common does in

109
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,640
the description sections of every important section and it gives you a much more in-depth description

110
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,700
of what the commander actually does.

111
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,430
This is likely going to be one of the most useful parts of the man page for any command.

112
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,170
And as it will try to explain what the commanders in plain English.

113
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,910
OK so you've got the which command description there and here you've got these in the synopsis section

114
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,380
we can see a layout of how to actually use the command.

115
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,930
So German when I was telling you the each command is structured differently and you need to read the

116
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,110
manual pages to see how to use a command.

117
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,530
Well this is the section of the manual page that will tell you how to use the command.

118
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,910
The synopsis section.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,430
So for the which come on we can see the first type which OK.

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,160
The command name and then we see the A option in some square brackets which will come into in a minute

121
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,800
and then some kind of file name.

122
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,360
And then three dots although also known as an ellipsis afterwards.

123
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,960
So let me explain what this stuff means.

124
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:12,110
OK so first we enter the which come they will just type which then we have the option which is optional.

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,430
Now we know it's optional because it's inside the square brackets in a man page.

126
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,420
If something is inside square brackets that means it's optional.

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,960
OK you don't have to enter it but you can.

128
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,500
OK.

129
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,670
Now next after that once we've entered our optional option we.

130
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,390
Next you have to enter the name of a command that you're actually looking for.

131
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,940
Now you can see so you enter a name when you looking for example which may be decay and then echo.

132
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,400
OK.

133
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,160
That would show you where the echo command was.

134
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,200
But you also see this ellipsis Oh these three dots that these three dots mean that you can enter more

135
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,610
than one file name.

136
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,650
So in other words the command can take more than one input.

137
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,400
Things are starting to fall into place now.

138
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,810
Right so how do you know how many inputs the command takes will you look at the man page you look at

139
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,750
the synopsis and it will tell you how many inputs it takes.

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,260
OK.

141
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,430
Now just to prove it.

142
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,000
OK.

143
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,650
Just prove this.

144
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,740
We're going to take what we've learned here.

145
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,680
And we're going to apply it.

146
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,440
OK so I'm going to go back and clear the screen presence by holding control in now and we're going to

147
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,790
see we're going to try and use the command to find the data command and the command at the same time.

148
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,480
OK.

149
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,920
So we've used the which command.

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,450
We didn't give it the option but we didn't have to because it's just option just optional because we

151
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,380
because it was in the square brackets and we've given it a one far name and then another I say if we

152
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,650
press enter that we see that we get two outputs and then it's found the locations of the date command

153
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,320
and then the count command.

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,820
We didn't need to run the command twice because if we look at the man page it tells us we can actually

155
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,360
give it more than one file name.

156
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:47,790
OK.

157
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,440
So that's really really useful and maybe not maybe something we wouldn't have known had to do.

158
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,510
We had not looked at the man page.

159
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,270
And as I said the things inside square brackets in the main page will be opened up again.

160
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,780
Things inside the square brackets are optional.

161
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,180
This kind of stuff you don't have to have but you can have and if you want to know what it does you

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,350
just go to the Options section.

163
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,350
So if I put in the option it says it'll print all the matching pathnames of each argument so all matching

164
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,240
pathnames so is short for all.

165
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,120
So what I could do is I could type which I could do.

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,320
Which date and cow but I could type dash.

167
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,870
And see if that does any difference.

168
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,810
It actually and it doesn't make any difference.

169
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,360
But it will show us all of the different all of the different results.

170
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,070
So maybe you know when I told you about searching searching on the path maybe this will allow us to

171
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,660
look in folders that were later on in the path if they had the same name as where they were earlier

172
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,080
on.

173
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,560
OK.

174
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,310
So there we go.

175
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,870
Now there's other the symbols in the manual pages such as angle brackets.

176
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,330
So these kind of things.

177
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:49,790
Right.

178
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,260
So if you have something inside here inside the manual page.

179
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,590
So if we have like which And then it was like this and then you had something ok inside angle brackets.

180
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,460
Anything inside the angle brackets is mandatory.

181
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,150
That means you have to have it.

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,850
OK.

183
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,630
So if you see something inside angle brackets that means you have to have it and you can't miss it at

184
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,560
all right.

185
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,340
So just bear that in mind.

186
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,420
There's also the pipe character.

187
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,230
So if I have an option here and it was something like say you had the f option.

188
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,850
OK.

189
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,490
Because there's a pipe character between the two options.

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,570
That means OK you have to pick one or the other.

191
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,190
OK so the pipe means one or the other.

192
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,750
You cannot have both.

193
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:41,590
So I couldn't type I couldn't type which which Dasch a death date.

194
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,280
OK I would have to type which dash A or which dash f couldn't have both.

195
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,390
That's what happens if you see something inside.

196
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,930
Inside angle brackets.

197
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,680
OK some second time I think again.

198
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,530
So the angle brackets with a pipe in between them.

199
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,120
OK so what Beduin so far.

200
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,970
OK.

201
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,690
It's probably what you'll come up with most of the time.

202
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,580
So these are all the different things that you'll see.

203
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,850
You'll have the name.

204
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,610
You have some options.

205
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,860
It will tell you which ones are optional and which ones you need and which ones cannot be combined with

206
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,870
others.

207
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,080
You will see things that may be a mantra inside square brackets and anything with a dot dot dot after

208
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,670
it means you can have more than one thing.

209
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,840
So if it's sad like this it was a file name was in it and then dot dot dot that means you can have more

210
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,600
than one file name when you use this command.

211
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
Now I'm actually going to put a PTF in the resort in the resource section for this lecture that lists

212
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,050
what the different symbols mean.

213
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,460
So you can use it if you ever need a quick refresher but it's pretty much all you need to remember.

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,760
OK.

215
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,820
Just the anything in square brackets is optional.

216
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,900
And with a pipe in between it you can only have one or the other anything and square anything in angle

217
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,630
brackets is mandatory.

218
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,150
And I think with dot dot dot after it you can use more than once because pretty much all you need to

219
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,520
know.

220
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,620
And if you want to know how to look up what different options do to scroll down to the Options section

221
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,200
in the main page and it'll tell you exactly how to use them all.

222
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,930
OK.

223
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,090
Awesome So we've covered a whole lot of stuff in this video and you should start feeling a lot more

224
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,210
comfortable using the command line already in this video.

225
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,710
So have to search the manual using the man command with the k option and after that you can give it

226
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,980
any search term that you want.

227
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,810
And the command will search the manual for that search term and give you a list of results as well as

228
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,730
what those results are and where section of the manual page they're in.

229
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:31,050
So I had to access those specific manual pages and also how to read them for specific command structure.

230
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,030
So we saw how Tota actually use the which command using its manual page.

231
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,290
And we saw the different symbols that might come up in the manual page to tell you how to use it.

232
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,920
But I've attached cheat sheet in the resources section for this video that I massively encourage you

233
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,390
to use and keep on hand because it's going to give you an explanation of each of the different symbols

234
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,570
that might show up in a manual page so that you can keep that to hand.

235
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,180
And you know make sure that you don't forget anything.

236
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,070
But to ensure that you don't forget anything.

237
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,880
Up next we're going to have some practice what we're going to do is we're going to go together and we're

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,600
going to look at we're going to search for a new command and we're going to read about how it works.

239
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,970
We can look at it's manual page and we're going to take that learning and actually apply it and show

240
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,980
you how how you would take a man page that you've never seen before and learn how to use it.

241
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,360
So we're going to be applying what we've learned in this lecture about reading manual pages and apply

242
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,870
it to a completely new command and go through it together.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,650
And after that you should definitely feel as though hey any command or any manual page that I've come

244
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,030
up against I'll know how to read and know how to use which is going to give you a massive boost of confidence

245
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,100
and a massive boost of independence for you to explore and learn more about the Linux operating system.

246
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,110
So let's go ahead and jump into the next video and get some super super cool practice.
