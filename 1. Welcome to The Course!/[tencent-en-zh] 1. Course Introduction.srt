Now in this section you'll have to create delete copy paste edit rename move find open search archive

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
压缩文件等等，它将使您能够对文件做任何您想做的事情。
and compress files and so much more and it'll make you able to do anything you want with files.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,120
