Hello and congratulations for making the decision to sign up to the cause and propel yourself towards

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,390
the next mastery.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,250
Hi I'm Ziyad and I wanted to do a quick video to congratulate you for making the excellent decision

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,780
to sign up and I wanted to give you a quick introduction to what we'll be covering in the course.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,830
So first we're going to get you all set up with Linux by walking you through step by step through an

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,770
installation of Linux on your own virtual machine.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,610
Now doing it this way means that you can play around with whatever you like without risking anything

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
or damaging anything and anything can really go wrong.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,080
Think of it as your perfect playground to the awesome skills that you'll learn in the course.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,260
Then we're going to move on to learn all about the Linux terminal.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,030
An incredibly powerful program that is your gateway to doing anything that you want on your Linux machine.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,800
We'll discuss what the terminal is how to use it how to enter commands and clear up popular misconceptions

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,370
that may be floating around.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,200
Now the important concepts that you'll learn in that section of the Course will lay the critical foundations

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,980
for everything that you'll do within an X command line and it will make it all start to make sense.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,340
Well then move on to discuss the Linux file system and how to work with files that work working with

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,680
files is probably 99 percent of what we do on a on an everyday basis.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,430
And so when something had to work with files effectively and efficiently using the command line is an

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,080
incredible ability to game.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,810
Now in this section you'll have to create delete copy paste edit rename move find open search archive

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
and compress files and so much more and it'll make you able to do anything you want with files.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,120
But with the efficiency of the command line it's going to be awesome.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
We'll then move on to how to automate tasks using bash scripts so you had to write bash scripts and

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,900
how to schedule these scripts to run at certain dates and times.

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,390
So you can automate your daily workflow and finally you'll learn all about installing third party software

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,520
on your Linux machine.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,870
You don't have to search for new software from the software repositories and how to manage your software

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,550
using software managers.

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,700
You'll also learn about open source software and what it means to be part of the open source community

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,230
as well as learning how to take source code and compile it into working programs.

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,980
Now by the end of this course you'll be comfortable using the Linux operating system and you'll wonder

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,360
why you haven't been using it all along.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,150
And one thing I always aim for in my courses is to make the content on forgetable so I had to help cement

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,810
the learning.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,310
You have quizzes to check your grasping the concepts and you also have some assignments for you to complete

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,050
to really test and improve your skills and there are also some cheat sheets summarizing the concepts

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,510
from the course so you don't need to take notes to sit back relax and practice the skills.

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
And rest assured that the important information is jotted down for you in professionally designed cheat

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
sheets for free to refer to whenever you want.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,190
Now if you ever need any help feel free to ask questions in the questions area and when you feel you've

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,210
got immersed in the course please leave a review to encourage other students take the course so we can

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,770
make the joys of the Linux operating system accessible to everyone.

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,070
Other than that I wish you a very pleasant time learning Linux in the course and I bet you can't wait

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,880
to get started.

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,030
So let's jump right in and get you set up with your own Linux virtual machine.
