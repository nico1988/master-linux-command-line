00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,380
大家好，美女们，欢迎收看这个视频。
Hello beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,690
我们将执行最后一步，在虚拟机中设置您的a Buntu安装。
We're going to be doing the final step of setting up your a buntu installation inside the virtual machine.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,490
虽然我们应该说，如果您确实在此过程中遇到任何错误，如您所知，它会显示虚拟的
Though we should say that if you do get any errors in this process like you know it says the virtual

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,630
机器崩溃只需在虚拟框中转到此处，单击设置系统，然后将此栏拖低一点
machine crashes just go over here in virtual box click on settings system and drag this bar a bit lower

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,810
向下进入果岭。
down into the green.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,300
好的，只是为了给你的主机增加一点内存，以防万一。
Ok just that just to give your host computer or just a bit more memory in case it needs.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,730
好的。
OK.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,030
所以以防万一，但如果真的发生了，也不用担心。
So just in case that happens but don't worry if it does.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,780
没什么不对劲的，把它合上就行了。
Nothing's gone wrong just close it.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,420
把横杆缩小到果岭，然后再试一次。
Reduce that bar down to the green and then try again.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,830
好的。
OK.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,040
但是我们现在要做的是，我们将在虚拟框中打开，我们将单击
But we're going to do now is we're going to we're going to open in virtual box we're going to click

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,690
从我们的功能虚拟机开始。
start on our ability virtual machine.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,170
这样做的目的是在我们的计算机中打开一台假想的计算机。
And while this is going to do is it's going to open up an imaginary computer inside our computer.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,450
所以这真是太棒了。
So this is super awesome.

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,860
如果您想要安装一个Buntu，这就是您必须经历的实际过程
And this is the actual process that you would have to go through if you wanted to install a buntu for

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,010
REAL作为实际计算机上唯一的操作系统。
real as the only operating system on an actual computer.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,190
所以现在开放的东西叫做虚拟机。
So what's opening up now is called a virtual machine.

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,080
它是计算机内部的一台虚构的计算机，它认为您正在上面安装操作系统
It's an imaginary computer inside a computer that thinks you're installing an operating system on it

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,160
因为我们是从那张直播CD启动的。
because we're booting from that live CD.

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,770
好的。
OK.

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,500
所以我们在上一段视频中下载所有假想的磁盘文件。
So all that imaginary disk file that we downloaded in the last video.

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,750
所以我们现在要做的就是在这个假想的
So what we're going to have to do now is we're just going to have to install a buntu on this imaginary

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,240
这是一个非常简单的过程，正如你所看到的。
computer and it's really easy process as you can see.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,660
它现在已经打开了，它会给我们两个选项，它会说，试着安装两个。
It's opened up now and it's going to give us two options it's going to say try to install two.

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,580
我要先走一步。
I'm going to go ahead.

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,070
您要做的是单击安装，但请确保从侧面选择您想要的任何语言
What you do is click install to but make sure you pick whatever language you would like from the side

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,340
这里。
here.

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,580
我将它保留为英文，然后单击Install a Buntu。
I'm going to keep it in English and then click install a buntu.

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,530
好的。
OK.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,000
因此，它将在这里为您提供一些额外的选择。
So with that it's going to give you some extra options here.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,210
这两个箱子都拿去吧。
Take both of these boxes.

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,360
这将允许它在安装Kubuntu时更新、下载和一些更新。
This one is going to allow it to update download and some updates when installing Kubuntu.

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,970
这将安装第三方软件，如Wi-Fi硬件、MP3播放器和其他东西
And this is going to install third party software such as Wi-Fi hardware MP3 players and other stuff

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,020
只是为了让您了解您的体验更加完整，并让您的虚拟机变得您了解
just to make you know your your experience a bit more complete and make your virtual machine you know

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,540
只是比其他情况下多了几个功能。
just have a few more features than it would otherwise.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,130
因此，请继续并选择这两个框，然后单击继续。
So go ahead and take both those boxes and then click continue.

00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,630
然后它会给我们一些其他的选择，让我们在下一个屏幕上玩。
And then it's going to give us some other options to play with on the next screen.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,970
这一点需要一点时间。
This bit's taking a little bit of time.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,600
我们走吧。
There we go.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,950
据说这台电脑目前没有检测到任何操作系统。
It's saying the computer currently has detected no operating systems.

42
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,180

嗯，只要点击一下就行了。
