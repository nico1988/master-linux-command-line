00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,550
美丽的人们大家好，欢迎收看这个视频。
Hello the beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,830
我们将使用您自己的运行特定风格的Linux虚拟机进行设置
We're going to be getting you set up with your very own Linux virtual machine running a specific flavor

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,030
被称为Buntu的Linux的。
of Linux called a buntu.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,470
所以Linux的风格在Linux行话中被称为发行版，我们将为您设置
So flavors of Linux are called distributions in the Linux lingo and we're going to be getting you set

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,980
为您的虚拟机器虚拟机提供Linux的Ubuntu发行版。
up with Ubuntu distribution of Linux for your virtual box virtual machines.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,050
所以我们要做的就是总是带着一个项目符号走到窗口，从.com下载它的
So we're going to do is always a head over to the window with a bullet to dot com for download for its

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
最后一个桌面。
last desktop.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,210
我将在资源部分放置一个链接，用于此视频，或者您可以直接转到
I will be putting a link in the resources section and for this video or you could just head over to

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,470
你最喜欢的搜索引擎和搜索按钮下载，它将是第一件事
your favorite search engine and search for a button to download and it'll be the first thing that comes

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,440
当你点击它的时候，你会发现一个像这样的页面。
up and when you click on it you'll find a page that looks like this.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,540
现在，我们不希望您这样做，我们将为您提供多个选项，您可以选择使用哪种版本的Buntu
Now we don't want you to do and is going to give you multiple options of what version of a buntu you

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,480
想要下载。
want to download.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,640
但我希望您点击最新的选项。
But I want you to click on the most up to date option.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,990
举个例子，我这里有，我去过17.10。
So for example here I've got I've been to seventeen point ten.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,320
现在有一件有趣的事情，你实际上可以告诉我们Buntu发行版是什么时候发布的，只需看一下
Now one interesting thing you can actually tell when the buntu releases were released by just looking

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,030
从版本号上，Sahira可以看出它是在2000年发布的，在第10个月发布了17个月，这将
at the version number Sahira can tell that it was released in 2000 and 17 in the tenth month which would

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,080
就是这里的十月。
be October of here.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,930
例如，我可以看到这是在2000年发布的，16年是在第四个月发布的，这将是
For example I can see that this was released in 2000 and 16 in the fourth month which is going to be

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,590
四月。
April.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,640
因此，更新的版本号越多，就意味着它们发布的时间越晚。
So the more up to date version numbers mean they were released later on.

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,070
好的。
OK.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,510
所以我们要做的就是点击它。
So what we're going to do is we're going to click in it will.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,040
任何人都会点击17：10，但你只需点击对你来说最新的内容，它就会
Anyone going to click on to 17:10 but you just click on whatever is most up to date for you it will

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,120
不会影响您的课程体验，无论如何，整个费用对您来说都是一样的
not affect your experience of the course the entire cost will be the same for you regardless whatever

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,740
您可以选择最新的版本，但您也可以选择最新的版本。
version you pick but you might as well have the most up to date version.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,040
所以当你点击下载时，它会打开另一个页面，在那里它会要求我提供几笔捐款
So when you click download and it can open up another page where it's going to ask me for a few donations

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,440
但我要说的是，很遗憾，我今天不会在这里捐钱，我会
but I'm going to say unfortunately that I'm not going to donate any money here today and I'm going to

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,590
将被带到下载位置。
be taken to the download.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,490
但是你可以随心所欲地做任何你想做的事。
And but you feel free to do whatever you want to do.

30
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,020
好的。
OK.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,710
然后它会开始将所谓的磁盘镜像文件下载到我的计算机上，然后我会
And then it's going to start to download what's called a disk image file to my computer and I'm going

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,170
为我自己单击并保存在Downloads文件夹中。
to click and save it in the Downloads folder for myself.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,760
你可以随心所欲地下载。
You can download it wherever you want.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,060
您会注意到下载开始了。
And you'll notice that a download starts to begin.

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,560
现在这些ISO文件过去是10个，通常是相当大的，通常在千兆字节的数量级上，所以
Now these ISO files used to be 10 usually tend to be quite large usually on the order of gigabytes so

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,810
您可以在这里看到这是1.4 GB大小。
you can see here that this is 1.4 gigabytes in size.

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,040
因此，这可能需要相当长的一段时间，这取决于您的互联网有多快。
So this might take quite a while depending on how quick your Internet is.

38
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,460
现在你必须等待它继续下载，我要做的是我要把
Now you have to wait for that to go ahead and downloads what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut the

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,720
视频在这里。
video here.

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,160
我下载后会回来的，所以只要耐心点，她就不会真的
I'm going to come back when it is downloaded so just be patient with it she won't ever have to really

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,280
再来一次。
do it again.

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,830
所以，一旦它完成了，它就完成了。
And so once it's done it's done.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,120
因此，只需等待该内容下载，然后取消暂停视频，即可继续使用睡觉
So just wait for that thing to download and then unpause the video to follow through with the rest of

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
设置好了。
the set up.

45
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,430
好的，下载尚未完成，现在我可以继续安装虚拟机，这样您
OK so the download has gone incompleted and now I can go ahead and install the virtual machine so you

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,870
我可以看到，我们已经将此磁盘映像文件保存在我的下载文件夹中。
can see that we've got this disk image file saved in my downloads folder.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,910
有了这一点，我们将有一个开放的虚拟盒子，虚拟盒子。
And with that there we're going to go had an open up virtual box virtual box.

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,990
在这里您可以设置虚拟机并尝试运行，并且您可以拥有多个交换机
This is where you can set up virtual machines and try to run and you can have more than one switch is

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
正在创建新的虚拟机。
going to create a new virtual machine.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,120
我要称它为Buntu，因为我很有想象力，你可以看到它找到了
I'm going to call it a buntu because I am imaginative and call it and you can see it's it's found the

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,080
类型是Linux和Buntu 64位，这就是我的那个。
type which is Linux and a buntu 64 bit which is which is what my one was.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,450
如果你的下载是32位的，那么继续点击到32位。
And if yours was a 32 bit download then go ahead and click to 32 bit.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,190
但我认为默认情况下应该是64位，所以我就不说了。
But I think by default it should be a 64 bit so I'll leave it at that.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,560
现在我下一个被击中，它将询问我要分配的内存或RAM的大小(以MB为单位
Now I get hit next and it's going to ask me for the amount of memory or RAM in megabytes to be allocated

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
到虚拟机。
to the virtual machine.

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,190
这里需要注意的重要一点是，这仅在虚拟机运行时分配
Now an important thing to note here that this is only allocated when the virtual machine is running

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,220
当您关闭虚拟机时启用虚拟。
when you turn the virtue when you close a virtual machine.

58
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,680
它会的。
It will.

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,550
它将被归还给主机。
It will be given back to the host computer.

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,370
所以不要太担心这个，只要给它一个慷慨的数额，让我们说，大约，我们说
So don't worry about this too much just give it a generous amount so let's say up to about let's say

61
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,950
大约四分之三或80%的果岭距离你不想一直走到这里
about three quarters or 80 percent of the green distance you don't want to go all the way up to here

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,580
因为这可能会使您的系统出现一点卡顿和抖动。
because this might make your system stutter a bit and jittery a bit.

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,130
所以只要走到果岭的大部分路，直到果岭的尽头，但不能一直走到果岭的尽头。
So just take it most of the way up to the green to the end of the green but not all the way.

64
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,590
所以在那里留出一些缓冲空间。
So leave some buffer room there.

65
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,840
好的，那我就到此为止了。
OK so I'm going to leave it at that.

66
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,470
照我说的做。
Do it by.

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,800
这不是一门完美的科学。
This isn't a perfect science.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,220
你可以想象，到那时，你会问你关于硬盘的问题，那就是
Just go ahead and do it by then is going to ask you about a hard disk now that you can imagine is that

69
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,890
这个虚拟机认为它是一台计算机，而计算机需要一个硬盘空间。
this virtual machine is thinks that it's a computer and a computer needs a hard drive space.

70
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,270
好的。
OK.

71
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,290
所以我们要做的是创建一个虚拟的硬盘，这个虚拟的盒子就是这台机器
So what we're doing is we're creating an imaginary hard drive that this virtual box is this which machine

72
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,290
会认为这是一个真正的硬盘。
is going to think is a real hard drive.

73
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,390
但它实际上只是我们实际电脑上保存的一个文件。
But it's actually just a file saved on our actual computer.

74
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,740
好的。
OK.

75
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,610
所以我们现在能做的就是创建一个虚拟硬盘。
So what we can do is we get to create a virtual hard disk now.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,660
这会创建它，它会告诉您希望它是什么类型，只需将其作为第一个选项保留为虚拟的
So this creates it and it says what type do you want it to be just leave it as the first option a virtual

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,450
将磁盘映像装箱，或者就这样放在那里。
box disk image or leave it just like that.

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,170
然后它会说你想让它成为。
And then it's going to say do you want it to be.

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,160
您希望文件日期是动态分配还是固定大小和动态分配方式
Do you want the file dates to be dynamically allocated or fixed size and dynamically allocated means

80
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,170
当数据填满我想象中的硬盘时，火将变得更大且大小固定
that when when the data fills up on my imaginary harddrive the fire will get bigger and fix size means

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,970
不管是什么大小，文件都会是这个大小。
that the file will be that size no matter what.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,780
即使出于效率的考虑，它基本上是空的，我们也只需要动态分配它即可。
Even if it's basically empty for efficiency sake let's just have it dynamically allocated.

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,490
然后，您可以随心所欲地将其命名，并通过单击此箭头将其存储在您想要的任何位置
And then you can call it whatever you want and store it wherever you want by clicking this this arrow

84
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,810
此处更改您想要保存它的位置，但如果您不特别需要，请将其保留为默认位置
here to change where you want to save it but just leave it as the default if you don't particularly

85
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,050
速度快，这不是很重要，你给它多大的尺寸，我倾向于给我的20
fast and it doesn't really matter massively and how much size you give it I tend to just give my 20

86
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,260
千兆字节通常是绰绰有余的。
gigabytes that's usually more than enough.

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,630
但是你可以，你可以选择适合你的。
But you can you can just choose what's all right for you.

88
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,470
你知道，只要你有超过一两千兆字节的东西，你就应该完全没问题。
It's you know as long as you've got something above one or two gigabytes you should be absolutely fine.

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,210
因此，我将有20 GB的空间用作虚拟硬盘，然后我将单击
So so I'm just going to have 20 gigabytes there for it as an imaginary hard disk and I'm going to click

90
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,060
创建。
Create.

91
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,560
好的。
OK.

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,670
所以我们就快到了，我们非常非常接近。
So we're almost there and we're very very close.

93
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,590
我们要做的就是单击设置以设置更多内容，以确保
We've got to do is click on settings to set up a few more things so to make sure that are to make sure

94
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,920
我们的虚拟机的功率只是稍微高一点。
that our virtual machine has just a bit more power.

95
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,140
我们要做的是单击设置，进入系统，然后单击处理器处理
What we're going to do is we're going to click on settings go to System and click Proceso the processor

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,590
制表符，如果您有两个原因，则将其增加到两个原因。
tab and increase this to two cause if you have them.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,350
所以这里有两个处理器，或者一直到绿灯的尽头。
So two processors or up to the end of the green here.

98
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,760
因此，我要做的基本上就是让虚拟机具有更高的性能。
So what I'm going to do that just basically allows the virtual machine to just have that bit more performance.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,430
好的。
OK.

100
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,020
除了您单击存储时，还有最后一件事要做之外，其他一切都应该是一样的。
And everything else should be the same except when you click on storage there's one final thing to do.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:12,090
在存储上，这就是我们要插入磁盘映像的地方，因此您可以想象
So on storage This is where we're going to basically insert that disk image so you can imagine that

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,490
虚构的计算机从豆瓣Buntu映像引导到一台真实的计算机。
the imaginary computer booting from that Douban buntu image into a real computer.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,230
这有点让人困惑，不过请跟我来，点击存储，然后你会在这里看到这一点
It's a bit confusing but just follow with me it's click on storage then you'll see this bit here where

104
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,960
它显示控制器ID，并且它将有一个显示为空的磁盘。
it says controller ID and it will have a disk that says empty.

105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,380
好的。
OK.

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,210
单击，然后单击顶部的这张桌子右击，它将显示选择虚拟光学
So click then click on this desk at the top right click that and it will say choose virtual optical

107
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,850
磁盘文件显示单击锁定，然后我们将转到我的下载文件夹，并单击Ribband至17点
disk file says Click lock then we'll go to my downloads folder and click on ribband to seventeen point

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,590
我们下载的10个磁盘映像或您下载的任何磁盘映像版本
ten disk image that we downloaded or whatever disk image version that you downloaded you're able to

109
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,390
版本单击打开。
version click open.

110
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,660
现在一切都准备好了。
And now that's that's all set up.

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,600
单击确定。
Click OK.

112
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
我们基本上都可以出发了。
And we're basically all good to go.

113
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,290
所有这些都准备好了，在下一个视频中，我们将带您一览无余。
So that's all set up ready to go and in the next video we're going to run you through.

114
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,610
安装的最后一步是在实际的Buntu机器启动时对其进行设置。
And the final bit of the installation which is setting up the actual buntu machine when it boots up.
