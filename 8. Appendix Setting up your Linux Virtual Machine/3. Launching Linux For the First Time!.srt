00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,380
Hello beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,690
We're going to be doing the final step of setting up your a buntu installation inside the virtual machine.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,490
Though we should say that if you do get any errors in this process like you know it says the virtual

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,630
machine crashes just go over here in virtual box click on settings system and drag this bar a bit lower

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,810
down into the green.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,300
Ok just that just to give your host computer or just a bit more memory in case it needs.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,730
OK.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,030
So just in case that happens but don't worry if it does.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,780
Nothing's gone wrong just close it.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,420
Reduce that bar down to the green and then try again.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,830
OK.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,040
But we're going to do now is we're going to we're going to open in virtual box we're going to click

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,690
start on our ability virtual machine.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,170
And while this is going to do is it's going to open up an imaginary computer inside our computer.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,450
So this is super awesome.

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,860
And this is the actual process that you would have to go through if you wanted to install a buntu for

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,010
real as the only operating system on an actual computer.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,190
So what's opening up now is called a virtual machine.

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,080
It's an imaginary computer inside a computer that thinks you're installing an operating system on it

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,160
because we're booting from that live CD.

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,770
OK.

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,500
So all that imaginary disk file that we downloaded in the last video.

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,750
So what we're going to have to do now is we're just going to have to install a buntu on this imaginary

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,240
computer and it's really easy process as you can see.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,660
It's opened up now and it's going to give us two options it's going to say try to install two.

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm going to go ahead.

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,070
What you do is click install to but make sure you pick whatever language you would like from the side

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,340
here.

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm going to keep it in English and then click install a buntu.

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,530
OK.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,000
So with that it's going to give you some extra options here.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,210
Take both of these boxes.

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,360
This one is going to allow it to update download and some updates when installing Kubuntu.

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,970
And this is going to install third party software such as Wi-Fi hardware MP3 players and other stuff

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,020
just to make you know your your experience a bit more complete and make your virtual machine you know

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,540
just have a few more features than it would otherwise.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,130
So go ahead and take both those boxes and then click continue.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,630
And then it's going to give us some other options to play with on the next screen.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,970
This bit's taking a little bit of time.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,600
There we go.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,950
It's saying the computer currently has detected no operating systems.

42
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,180
Would you what would you like to do.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,990
Well just click.

44
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,600
Just have erase disk and install buntu to go ahead and click Install now.

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,150
It's going to say do you want to write the changes just click continue.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,670
That's perfectly fine.

47
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,430
And now it's going to ask you where in the world are you now.

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,680
This is just for timezone purposes and you can click on different areas depending on what you might

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,840
wear where you might be if you know you've got the US over here in the UK so I'm going to click there

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,760
and it's going to and actually I want to have London as my time zone.

51
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:53,760
So there we are it says London and we're going to click continue and now we're going to ask you for

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,020
your keyboard layout.

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,000
Mine's English UK so I'm going to I'm going to click English OK and that's going to be fine for me but

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,910
you can actually if I just go back sorry you can test your keyboard Leo by clicking detect keyboard

55
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,390
layout and typing one of these keys if I press y in there and then another one and then is at present

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
no it's not.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
It'll figure it out for me.

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,690
Which keyboard I should be using.

59
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,900
And then it will help me out pick it pick it out or not but I can just also select it from the list.

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,970
It's up to you.

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,140
English is fine for me.

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,890
You just go ahead and pick whatever is good for you.

63
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,390
Then click continue.

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,900
And then it's asking you for your username so I'm going to put Ziyad as my username.

65
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,790
It's going to ask me for a computer name it can automatically generate that but I'm going to call my

66
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:44,220
VB for virtual box picking a user name Ziyad and then it's going to ask me for passwords I'm going to

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,530
enter a password is weak password don't judge me.

68
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,020
To a fantastic password.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,640
So there we are we've entered that and it says require a password to log in and keep that checked and

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
that's all you really need to do.

71
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,670
But make sure you do remember this password because it will come very useful throughout the course.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,310
And if you want to use your virtual machine and not be locked out so do remember that one.

73
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,660
Then click continue.

74
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:17,340
And now what it's going to do is it's going to go about installing all of a buntu onto this virtual

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,880
machine.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,140
And it's telling can you know you've got some information about to hit as fast and full of new features.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,190
The latest version of a buntu makes computing easier than ever.

78
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,550
Here are just a few cool new things to look out for.

79
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,520
And you can click on this arrow and it says find even more software say goodbye to having to search

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,540
the web for new software with access to software store.

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,670
You can install new apps with ease.

82
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,610
Just type in what you're looking for or explore categories such as science education and games all alongside

83
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,870
helpful reviews from other users.

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,520
Awesome.

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,940
You can take your music with you.

86
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,730
Buntu comes with the amazing Rhythmbox music player with advanced playback options.

87
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,320
It's simple to cue up the perfect songs and it works great with CDs and portable music player so you

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,050
can enjoy all your music wherever you go.

89
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,180
Wonderful and you can keep clicking through these things.

90
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,100
The stuff about photos.

91
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,440
Web browsing so it already comes with Firefox for example and it also comes with its own suite of office

92
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,780
software so basically similar software to Microsoft Word Microsoft Excel Powerpoint and so on.

93
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,940
Com for free.

94
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,130
They could also work with Microsoft Office files that's useful.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,070
You've got other things they said accessibility options if you need any particular accessibility options.

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,940
When you use your computer they also are included as well.

97
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,760
You can have them.

98
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,550
It tells you about some help and support from the Ubuntu team.

99
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,020
So what this is doing is it's basically just going to install loads of software on your computer it's

100
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,690
going to do a full install of a bunch too and it might take a bit of time depending upon you know just

101
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,430
how quick your computer is installing stuff really.

102
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,650
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep the video here and then I'm going to come back when this

103
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,810
installation has finished and to continue the rest of the way.

104
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,170
OK and I'm back and you can see that the installation is now complete.

105
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,330
It says you need to restart the computer in order to use the new installation so I'm going to click

106
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,570
restart now and that should shut down the virtual machine just like that and it says to remove the installation

107
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,500
medium.

108
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,930
Please remove the installation medium then press and do so I'm going to press enter.

109
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:26,810
And that should now start booting up the buntu virtual machine again but this time without having to

110
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,130
install it anymore us wait for this to open.

111
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,810
Very exciting and there we go.

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,150
It's now popped up and said hey here's my username which is Ziyad.

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,410
I can click on that I can enter my password and click enter or click sign in and it's going to show

114
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,020
me this.

115
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,990
This rather awesome looking hacker stuff.

116
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,690
And there we are.

117
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,940
We've now gone ahead and successfully installed a buntu on our virtual machines.

118
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,110
Isn't that awesome.

119
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,220
What we've got here we can you know you can see you've got the Firefox browser installed you've got

120
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,280
Rhythmbox which is like a music player.

121
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,450
You've got files which is like your file Navigator will be using this quite a bit in the course.

122
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:13,830
You've got folders installed here you've got software center which is going to be a way for you to download

123
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,450
Xserve software we won't use this directly in the course but it's there in case you wanted to browse

124
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,690
and have a look at.

125
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,870
You know you can browse through the old Add-Ons you can have a look out here and there's so much to

126
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,020
do.

127
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,270
You've got up here you've got different settings and stuff you can take a look at your settings and

128
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,540
really what I want you to do is I want you to have a play around with this stuff it works.

129
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,320
It's just a computer guys kind of thing.

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,890
Things are just laid out in a different way but it's it's not going to be too strange compared to what

131
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,940
you're already used to.

132
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,750
Things might have a few different names.

133
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,410
And one thing that's good is to show applications.

134
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,320
Button Down here which when you click that it will open up in a rather awesome way showing you some

135
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,740
applications that are installed that you can click on to have a lockout so you've got Thunderbird which

136
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,370
is like an email client videos which shows you videos games and here such as Margene.

137
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,940
You've got Liebreich office which is like Microsoft Office calculator because math and you've also got

138
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,560
text editors and loads of loads of really awesome things on here.

139
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,640
OK so one thing that we're going to be making a lot of use of of course is the terminal which is what

140
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,290
you guys came here to learn.

141
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,360
So with that all set up and once you've got yourself comfortable with this it should take you about

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,210
five minutes or so it's really easy to get used to.

143
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,840
What are we going to do in the next video is get you started learning how to use commands and when it

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,440
says here updated software has been issued Do you want to install it now.

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,240
Sure go ahead just go ahead and click Install now and wait for that installation process to complete

146
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,460
it should sort itself out on its own.

147
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,800
Ask you for your password.

148
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,100
You had to enter that to give it some permission to go ahead and do the installation and you should
