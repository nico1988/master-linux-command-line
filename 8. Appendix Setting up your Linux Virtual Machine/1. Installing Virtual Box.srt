00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello you beautiful people.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,850
And welcome to this video.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,520
We're going to be getting you set up with virtual box on your computer.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,160
Now virtual box is an amazing piece of software that allows you to run what are called virtual machines

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,980
on your computer.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,390
Now virtual machines other than having a totally awesome sounding name allow you to run virtual computers

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,390
inside your computer without affecting your actual computer so they're perfect for running things like

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,320
new operating systems and trying them out without affecting the way that your current computer works

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,120
so running a virtual machine through virtual box is going to create the perfect playground for us to

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,900
try the Linux operating system that is affecting the way that your actual computer works.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,140
So nothing can actually go wrong so it's the perfect playground for us to try out the software.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,830
So what I want to do is always a head over to the Virtual Box website which is not virtual box dot org

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,350
for Wiki for downloads.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,340
I put a link in the resources section for this video or you could just have it or you could just head

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,440
over to your favorite search engine and just search for Virtual Box download and it will likely be the

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,640
first link that comes up.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,030
And when you click it you'll come to a page like this.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,450
OK.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,740
Now here you go find some some links to some specific executable installer files that I want you to

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,120
download a case if you're on Windows I want you to click Windows hosts if you're a Mac and we to click

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,650
OS 10 hosts OK and if you want if you're already on Linux you basically don't need to install Linux

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,640
do you so you can just skip this entire section and move on to actual learning stuff.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,080
But here we are if you want Windows click Windows if you are on Mac I was 10 but I'm on Windows Sangli

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,430
click that and you can download and install a file here.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:31,920
OK.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,030
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to just save that in my downloads folder but you can save that

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,870
wherever is best for you but I can save it in my downloads folder and it's going to download and install.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,560
And it's going to install Virtual Box for us.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,020
OK.

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,790
So that's going to headend downloaded what should be in just about two seconds or so.

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,610
There we are.

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,800
It's downloading I'm going to click that or head over to my downloads folder and double click.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,460
However however I wish I could double click the ticket with the same thing and it's going to open up

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,420
this install a wizard which were just going to basically power through guys.

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,980
So I'm going to click next here.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,540
Going to click next again.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,400
And then it will ask you where do you want to put some shortcuts.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,630
I'm just going to have a shocker in my Start Menu and on the desktop but I don't really want one in

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,690
the quicklaunch bar but make sure you have this one here.

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,100
Make sure whatever you choose just don't uncheck register file associations just leave that with a tick.

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,550
OK that must stay the same.

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,880
Be play around with the others depending on how you want your system set up where you want the shortcuts.

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,450
It doesn't really matter.

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,760
You can remove them anyway but you know your preference then go ahead and click next.

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,520
It's going to say hey we might need to access your network interface.

46
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,780
Just say yes don't worry about that whatsoever.

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,350
And click install.

48
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,950
It might give us the pop ups.

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,110
Go ahead and click yes to any pop ups that come up or click install or just give it permission whatever

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,220
it means just go ahead and do it.

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,080
It's just going to be giving virtual virtual box the ability to have your virtual machines access the

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,890
Internet which is usually a useful function.

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,610
So just click yes to whatever it asks for and then it will come to the installation complete screen

54
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,960
and there'll be a tick box here that says start virtual box after installation.

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,470
Make sure that that has a tick in it and click Finish and it will go ahead and open up a virtual box.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,290
There you are guys that's how you go ahead and install virtual box.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,370
Nice and easy.

58
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,920
Click click click click click process.

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,160
So now that we've gone ahead and install virtual box in the next video we showed you how you can set

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,860
up your own Linux virtual machine.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,550
So folks watching this video guys you've now got virtual box installed on your machine.

62
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,080
Let's go ahead and set you up with Linux.
