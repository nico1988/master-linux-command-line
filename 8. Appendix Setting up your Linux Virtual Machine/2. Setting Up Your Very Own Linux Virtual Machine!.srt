00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,550
Hello the beautiful people and welcome to this video.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,830
We're going to be getting you set up with your very own Linux virtual machine running a specific flavor

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,030
of Linux called a buntu.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,470
So flavors of Linux are called distributions in the Linux lingo and we're going to be getting you set

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,980
up with Ubuntu distribution of Linux for your virtual box virtual machines.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,050
So we're going to do is always a head over to the window with a bullet to dot com for download for its

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
last desktop.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,210
I will be putting a link in the resources section and for this video or you could just head over to

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,470
your favorite search engine and search for a button to download and it'll be the first thing that comes

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,440
up and when you click on it you'll find a page that looks like this.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,540
Now we don't want you to do and is going to give you multiple options of what version of a buntu you

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,480
want to download.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,640
But I want you to click on the most up to date option.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,990
So for example here I've got I've been to seventeen point ten.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,320
Now one interesting thing you can actually tell when the buntu releases were released by just looking

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,030
at the version number Sahira can tell that it was released in 2000 and 17 in the tenth month which would

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,080
be October of here.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,930
For example I can see that this was released in 2000 and 16 in the fourth month which is going to be

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,590
April.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,640
So the more up to date version numbers mean they were released later on.

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,070
OK.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,510
So what we're going to do is we're going to click in it will.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,040
Anyone going to click on to 17:10 but you just click on whatever is most up to date for you it will

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,120
not affect your experience of the course the entire cost will be the same for you regardless whatever

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,740
version you pick but you might as well have the most up to date version.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,040
So when you click download and it can open up another page where it's going to ask me for a few donations

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,440
but I'm going to say unfortunately that I'm not going to donate any money here today and I'm going to

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,590
be taken to the download.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,490
And but you feel free to do whatever you want to do.

30
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,020
OK.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,710
And then it's going to start to download what's called a disk image file to my computer and I'm going

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,170
to click and save it in the Downloads folder for myself.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,760
You can download it wherever you want.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,060
And you'll notice that a download starts to begin.

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,560
Now these ISO files used to be 10 usually tend to be quite large usually on the order of gigabytes so

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,810
you can see here that this is 1.4 gigabytes in size.

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,040
So this might take quite a while depending on how quick your Internet is.

38
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,460
Now you have to wait for that to go ahead and downloads what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut the

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,720
video here.

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm going to come back when it is downloaded so just be patient with it she won't ever have to really

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,280
do it again.

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,830
And so once it's done it's done.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,120
So just wait for that thing to download and then unpause the video to follow through with the rest of

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
the set up.

45
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,430
OK so the download has gone incompleted and now I can go ahead and install the virtual machine so you

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,870
can see that we've got this disk image file saved in my downloads folder.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,910
And with that there we're going to go had an open up virtual box virtual box.

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,990
This is where you can set up virtual machines and try to run and you can have more than one switch is

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
going to create a new virtual machine.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm going to call it a buntu because I am imaginative and call it and you can see it's it's found the

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,080
type which is Linux and a buntu 64 bit which is which is what my one was.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,450
And if yours was a 32 bit download then go ahead and click to 32 bit.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,190
But I think by default it should be a 64 bit so I'll leave it at that.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,560
Now I get hit next and it's going to ask me for the amount of memory or RAM in megabytes to be allocated

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
to the virtual machine.

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,190
Now an important thing to note here that this is only allocated when the virtual machine is running

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,220
when you turn the virtue when you close a virtual machine.

58
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,680
It will.

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,550
It will be given back to the host computer.

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,370
So don't worry about this too much just give it a generous amount so let's say up to about let's say

61
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,950
about three quarters or 80 percent of the green distance you don't want to go all the way up to here

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,580
because this might make your system stutter a bit and jittery a bit.

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,130
So just take it most of the way up to the green to the end of the green but not all the way.

64
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,590
So leave some buffer room there.

65
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,840
OK so I'm going to leave it at that.

66
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,470
Do it by.

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,800
This isn't a perfect science.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,220
Just go ahead and do it by then is going to ask you about a hard disk now that you can imagine is that

69
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,890
this virtual machine is thinks that it's a computer and a computer needs a hard drive space.

70
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,270
OK.

71
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,290
So what we're doing is we're creating an imaginary hard drive that this virtual box is this which machine

72
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,290
is going to think is a real hard drive.

73
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,390
But it's actually just a file saved on our actual computer.

74
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,740
OK.

75
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,610
So what we can do is we get to create a virtual hard disk now.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,660
So this creates it and it says what type do you want it to be just leave it as the first option a virtual

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,450
box disk image or leave it just like that.

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,170
And then it's going to say do you want it to be.

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,160
Do you want the file dates to be dynamically allocated or fixed size and dynamically allocated means

80
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,170
that when when the data fills up on my imaginary harddrive the fire will get bigger and fix size means

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,970
that the file will be that size no matter what.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,780
Even if it's basically empty for efficiency sake let's just have it dynamically allocated.

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,490
And then you can call it whatever you want and store it wherever you want by clicking this this arrow

84
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,810
here to change where you want to save it but just leave it as the default if you don't particularly

85
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,050
fast and it doesn't really matter massively and how much size you give it I tend to just give my 20

86
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,260
gigabytes that's usually more than enough.

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,630
But you can you can just choose what's all right for you.

88
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,470
It's you know as long as you've got something above one or two gigabytes you should be absolutely fine.

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,210
So so I'm just going to have 20 gigabytes there for it as an imaginary hard disk and I'm going to click

90
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,060
Create.

91
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,560
OK.

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,670
So we're almost there and we're very very close.

93
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,590
We've got to do is click on settings to set up a few more things so to make sure that are to make sure

94
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,920
that our virtual machine has just a bit more power.

95
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,140
What we're going to do is we're going to click on settings go to System and click Proceso the processor

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,590
tab and increase this to two cause if you have them.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,350
So two processors or up to the end of the green here.

98
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,760
So what I'm going to do that just basically allows the virtual machine to just have that bit more performance.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,430
OK.

100
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,020
And everything else should be the same except when you click on storage there's one final thing to do.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:12,090
So on storage This is where we're going to basically insert that disk image so you can imagine that

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,490
the imaginary computer booting from that Douban buntu image into a real computer.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,230
It's a bit confusing but just follow with me it's click on storage then you'll see this bit here where

104
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,960
it says controller ID and it will have a disk that says empty.

105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,380
OK.

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,210
So click then click on this desk at the top right click that and it will say choose virtual optical

107
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,850
disk file says Click lock then we'll go to my downloads folder and click on ribband to seventeen point

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,590
ten disk image that we downloaded or whatever disk image version that you downloaded you're able to

109
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,390
version click open.

110
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,660
And now that's that's all set up.

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,600
Click OK.

112
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
And we're basically all good to go.

113
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,290
So that's all set up ready to go and in the next video we're going to run you through.

114
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,610
And the final bit of the installation which is setting up the actual buntu machine when it boots up.

115
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,620
So for all that goodness I'll see you in the next video.
