Hello you beautiful people and congratulations for making it through the course.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,000
So our journey together has taken you right from learning how to open the terminal and run commands

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,850
all the way to creating file archives writing automated scripts and managing thousands of pieces of

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,760
software using the package manager.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,510
So you truly have come an incredibly long way and I'm incredibly proud of you.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,590
Well done.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,950
And I just wanted to shoot this video to say thank you very much for coming along with me on this journey

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,390
through that Linux command line and I hope that you've received some benefit from our journey together

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,800
and I wish you the very best in the future.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,780
And if you do want to learn more do take a look at some of my other courses and keep an eye out for

11

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,840

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,400

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,770
For all my courses just to say thank you for being a student so go ahead and enroll in whatever you'd

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,240

18

I always listen to suggestions so send me a message and I'll do what ever I can to make that happen.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,460
And if you finish the course 100 percent.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,040
You should soon receive a certificate of completion from you to me by email for you to print off and

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,710
put on your linked in profile or to show proudly to the world that you are now and Linux master.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,580
And if you do have any troubles getting the certificate through do contact you to me support team on
