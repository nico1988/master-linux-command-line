00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,250
您好，您好，美丽的人，欢迎来到这个非常激动人心的关于自动化课程的章节
Hello you beautiful person and welcome to this very exciting section of the Course all about automating

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,210
使用bash脚本和Crohn的任务。
tasks using bash scripts and Crohn.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,860
到目前为止，您一直在学习如何在命令行上一个接一个地执行命令。
Now up until now you've been learning how to do commands one after the other on the command line.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,470
但是，有时您需要完成需要多个步骤的任务。
But sometimes however you want to complete tasks that require multiple steps.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,500
因此，与其每次只记住这些步骤并输入这些步骤，还不如记住这些命令步骤
So instead of just memorizing the steps and entering those steps those command steps every single time

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,900
你需要完成那项任务。
you need to complete that task.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,980
相反，您可以将这些命令写入称为bash脚本的文本文件中，然后只需运行该脚本
You can instead write those commands into a text file known as a bash script and then just run the script

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,530
再来一次。
again.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,430
当您运行脚本时，脚本中的每个命令都将从
And when you run the script each of the commands in the script will be run one after the other from

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,720
从上到下，这样节目将从脚本的顶部开始，然后一直向下
top to the bottom so the show will start at the top of the script and work its way down through the

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,800
在途中执行所有命令的脚本。
script executing all of the commands on the way.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,380
好的。
All right.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,540
因此，在本课程的这一节中，您将学习如何创建和运行您自己的bash脚本
So in this section of the course you're going to learn how to create and run your very own bash scripts

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,700
但您还将了解如何安排这些命令和后空翻在某些情况下运行
but you're also going to see how you can schedule those commands and backflips to be run at certain

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,050
使用一个非常方便的叫做Kramm的日程安排程序。
times using a really handy scheduling program called Krumm.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,050
现在，bash脚本本身就是一个庞大的领域。
Now bash scripting is a whole massive field in and of itself.

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,160
因此，这不会是课程的一个过于详细的部分，但我希望在这一部分结束时
So this won't be an overly detailed section of the course but I hope that by the end of the section

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,720
您将对糟糕的脚本编程有基本的概念和理解，这样您就可以
you'll have the fundamental concepts and understanding of what bad scripting is all about so that you

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,010
可以开始编写您自己的简单脚本了。
can start writing your own simple script.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,860
您还知道如何调度和自动化命令和脚本。
You also know how to schedule and automate commands and scripts.

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,840
任何时候你都可以通过使用Kramm书来选择，将这两种技能结合起来将会让你真正设置你的
Any time you choose by using Krumm book and combining these two skills will allow you to truly set your

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,670
自动驾驶的工作流程。
workflow on autopilot.

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,720
现在，您已经对本节将要介绍的内容有了一个快速的了解，让我们跳到
So now that you've got a quick heads up about what's going to be covered in this section let's jump

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,060
我们将在下一个视频中学习如何编写您自己的脚本。
right in in the next video by learning how to write your very own scripts.
