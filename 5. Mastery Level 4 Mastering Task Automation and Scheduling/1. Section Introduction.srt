Hello you beautiful person and welcome to this very exciting section of the Course all about automating

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,210
tasks using bash scripts and Crohn.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,860
Now up until now you've been learning how to do commands one after the other on the command line.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,470
But sometimes however you want to complete tasks that require multiple steps.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,500
So instead of just memorizing the steps and entering those steps those command steps every single time

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,900
you need to complete that task.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,980
You can instead write those commands into a text file known as a bash script and then just run the script

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,530
again.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,430
And when you run the script each of the commands in the script will be run one after the other from

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,720
top to the bottom so the show will start at the top of the script and work its way down through the

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,800
script executing all of the commands on the way.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,380
All right.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,540
So in this section of the course you're going to learn how to create and run your very own bash scripts

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,700
but you're also going to see how you can schedule those commands and backflips to be run at certain

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,050
times using a really handy scheduling program called Krumm.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,050
Now bash scripting is a whole massive field in and of itself.

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,160
So this won't be an overly detailed section of the course but I hope that by the end of the section

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,720
you'll have the fundamental concepts and understanding of what bad scripting is all about so that you

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,010
can start writing your own simple script.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,860
You also know how to schedule and automate commands and scripts.

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,840
Any time you choose by using Krumm book and combining these two skills will allow you to truly set your

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,670
workflow on autopilot.

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,720
So now that you've got a quick heads up about what's going to be covered in this section let's jump

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,060
right in in the next video by learning how to write your very own scripts.
