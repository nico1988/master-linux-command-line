<p>Hello there you beautiful person!</p><p>I just wanted to flag something up that is causing some of you trouble regarding the next video. Don’t worry; it’s only a very minor thing.</p><p>Ubuntu has updated a package to the repositories called <code>openafs-client</code> which now provides a command called “backup”.</p><p>The addition of the "backup" command to the <code>openafs-client</code> package means that, when you try to run a command called “backup”, if no script called “backup” is found on your system’s path, then the package manager will suggest that you try to install the <code>openafs-client</code> package.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-07-01_08-39-31-576150e757520e84057383c089d98302.png"></figure><p>In the upcoming video, we create a bash script called “backup”, which unless set up properly, can cause some confusion.</p><p>To avoid any hassle, just make sure to follow the video exactly, and put the backup script into your <code>~/bin</code> folder with execution permissions (<code>chmod +x backup</code>)</p><p>If you forget to give the “backup” script execution permissions, or if you forget to move it to the <code>~/bin</code> directory, you will run into the confusing message shown above.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Ziyad, 1st July 2020</p>
